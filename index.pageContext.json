Miko × Tojiko is technically incestuous. 🤔 Though I suppose it depends on how far up the tree the shared lineage is.\n\nSoga no Umako is Tojiko's dad.\n\nTo illustrate how terrifying Mahākāla is, his name means \"Great Time\" with a nuance of the time part also being death (out of time). Of course, when he arrived in Japan, he transformed into the almost completely different Daikokuten – in the same group of seven Buddhist gods as Bishamonten – which is also conflated with Ōkuninushi.\n\nThat is to say, Okina has links to both Shō and Tewi, among many, many more. \n\n* [Reddit #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1pm8vho/touhou_divine_genealogy_20_addendum_tl/)\n\n* [Reddit #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1pmhi9f/touhou_divine_genealogy_20_with_additional_info_tl/)","artistId":"nantara","characterIds":["yuyuko","eirin","kaguya","mokou","toyohime","yorihime","akyuu","sanae","kanako","suwako","tojiko","futo","miko","seija","shinmyoumaru","sagume","junko","hecatia","larva","eika","kutaka","keiki","misumaru","chimata","ariya","okina"],"nsfw":false},"featuredPosts":[{"date":1727794825000,"reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1ftq7bi","url":["https://i.redd.it/db829z53t5sd1.png"],"src":"https://x.com/simerike5/status/1841056188433391895","desc":"See, the back is counterweight for the front.
