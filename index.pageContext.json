The sentence can be divided like this:\n\n- 上は大火事\n- 下は大洪水\n- 間はジャングルのへんなやつ\n- ってだれ?\n\nWhich would be: \"Above Fire + Below Flood + Between Strange Jungle Thing = Who?\" However, if we time it differently as so:\n\n- 上は大火事\n- 下は大洪水\n- 間はジャングル\n- のへんなやつってだれ?\n\nThen it becomes: \"Above Fire + Below Flood + Between Jungle = Who This Strange Thing?\"\n\nOh, and this is a Japanese classic riddle. The answer is a bathtub. The hot thing above is the steam. The flood is the water. And this strange creature from the jungle is, well, a human. I think normally it has only the Fire and Flood parts though.\n\nAnd the older (and I think also the more well-known) rendition switches the Fire and Flood positions (when you heat your bathtub with actual fire being below.)","artistId":"nakache","characterIds":["nareko","chimi"],"nsfw":false},"featuredPosts":[{"date":1727794825000,"reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1ftq7bi","url":["https://i.redd.it/db829z53t5sd1.png"],"src":"https://x.com/simerike5/status/1841056188433391895","desc":"See, the back is counterweight for the front.
