## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this project is a static site with no backend or user authentication, the security surface is minimal. However, if you believe you've found a vulnerability or a misuse vector (e.g., malicious scripts in data, XSS), please report it by opening a **GitHub issue** or contacting [@AEnigmatrices](https://github.com/AEnigmatrices) directly on GitHub.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if applicable
- Your recommendation, if any

Responses to valid reports will typically occur within 5–7 days. Critical issues will be addressed as promptly as possible.
