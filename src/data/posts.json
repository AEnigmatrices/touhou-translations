Like, shit... the Three Fairies lived there before moving to the shrine!\n\nIf I were to guess, maybe the most uncomfortable aspect of the Forest of Magic is its very first description – it is the most **humid** place in Gensōkyō. Probably hell-on-earth in summer. 🔥🔥🔥 \n\nOkay, this is definitely my Japanese-hard moment. What Marisa's saying in the end is literally \"***Even if die, there is still a little more, right?***\" which I guess means that???",
