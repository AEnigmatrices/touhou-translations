It's about the WAAAGH!\n\nContext – Great Fairy Wars, Route C-2, Stage 3","artistId":"chitose_hachi","characterIds":["sunny"]},"artist":{"id":"chitose_hachi","name":"千歳はち","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Seachicken674","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/21620009","portrait":"portraits/artists/chitose_hachi.webp","artworkCount":10,"characterCount":19},"characters":[{"id":"sunny","name":"Sunny Milk","short_name":"Sunny","work":["sgs"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sunny.webp","artworkCount":2,"artistCount":2}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1diq1zt","img":"https://i.redd.it/rzrjbmumvb7d1.png"},{"id":"1i9m97k","img":"https://i.redd.it/fas7si7ez4fe1.png"},{"id":"1fnmu0h","img":"https://i.redd.it/hvnw6rczrkqd1.png"},{"id":"1jipxo9","img":"https://i.redd.it/8mmxln0zwmqe1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1fyz2yy","nextPostId":"1fzqltb"}}
