The key character here is \"意\", which I interpret it as \"thought\". But just in case, I looked it up a bit more. Another way of pronouncing this is \"Kokoro\". However, Kokoro's name is straight hiragana, so that's unlikely – not to mention the usual kanji for \"Kokoro\" is not this character.\n\nIt is used in Eirin's 八意 though. Yes, what I'm saying is Eirin's surname is literally \"Ya + Kokoro\". But due to the pronunciation convention, \"Yakokoro\" becomes \"Yagokoro\".","artistId":"sushirou","characterIds":["koishi"]},"artist":{"id":"sushirou","name":"すしろう","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/HeripanTomorrow","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/42276572","portrait":"portraits/artists/sushirou.webp","artworkCount":7,"characterCount":7},"characters":[{"id":"koishi","name":"Komeiji Koishi","short_name":"Koishi","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/koishi.webp","artworkCount":45,"artistCount":27}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1klny6y","img":"https://i.redd.it/hh50mg5vbk0f1.png"},{"id":"1ihi225","img":"https://i.redd.it/jogqdk5bn4he1.png"},{"id":"1iw9eyi","img":"https://i.redd.it/1hegiyysxvke1.png"},{"id":"1k9w09k","img":"https://i.redd.it/9b7fc8wyykxe1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1le2zr2","nextPostId":"1lekvp6"}}
