This idea is new to me – that she's a contemporary, and her living friends and families are still around.\n\nI can't tell the reason behind sweet osmanthus being the particular choice here, but literally it's \"Gold Tree **Rhino**\" – so I'm keen to think it's referencing the headbutt. It seems to be because the bark of the tree is kinda like rhino skin.\n\nThe part I put the hallway, entrance and corridor is really weird. The characters I see is \"garden\", but that part definitely ain't a garden, or a yard for the matter. 🤨 A vestibule? That also doubles as the kitchen?\n\nAnd TIL, that wooden platform you'd see when characters hangout at a house's backyard is called engawa.","artistId":"koyane","characterIds":["keine","mokou"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"koyane","name":"児屋","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Silver81106","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1225841","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"keine","name":"Kamishirasawa Keine","short_name":"Keine","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/keine.webp","artworkCount":14,"artistCount":11},{"id":"mokou","name":"Fujiwara no Mokō","short_name":"Mokō","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/mokou.webp","artworkCount":51,"artistCount":26}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mn71kx","img":"https://i.redd.it/ffug75ulkcif1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1na3837","img":"https://i.redd.it/3ksr7kgthknf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mtfu9x","img":"https://i.redd.it/9xuzr8mxiqjf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1myiya1","nextPostId":"1myzg8y"}}
