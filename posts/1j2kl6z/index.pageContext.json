That the characters who canonically have expressed their desire to eat human meat (e.g. Rumia, Meiling, Mystia...) are really just **gluttons**. Like, they'll salivate just as much over beef or chicken.\n\nThe vibe I picked from the *Perfect Memento* is that yōkai just so happen to not have anything against eating human meat.","artistId":"purabird","characterIds":["rumia"]},"artist":{"id":"purabird","name":"ぷらばーど","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/purabird0370","portrait":"/portraits/artists/purabird.webp","artworkCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"rumia","name":"Rumia","short_name":"Rumia","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/rumia.webp","artworkCount":19}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1hbsq4s","img":"https://i.redd.it/6kiimiggu76e1.png"},{"id":"1f78l40","img":"https://i.redd.it/0iymzkihsemd1.png"},{"id":"1esudmv","img":"https://i.redd.it/bm10nqfbrtid1.png"},{"id":"1d2j8hv","img":"https://i.redd.it/nsffv1fo263d1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1j2j1p2","nextPostId":"1j3a0gd"}}
