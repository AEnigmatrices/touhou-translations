That the characters who canonically have expressed their desire to eat human meat (e.g. Rumia, Meiling, Mystia...) are really just **gluttons**. Like, they'll salivate just as much over beef or chicken.\n\nThe vibe I picked from the *Perfect Memento* is that y≈çkai just so happen to not have anything against eating human meat.","artistId":"purabird","characterIds":["rumia"]}}}
