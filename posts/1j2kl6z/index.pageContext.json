That the characters who canonically have expressed their desire to eat human meat (e.g. Rumia, Meiling, Mystia...) are really just **gluttons**. Like, they'll salivate just as much over beef or chicken.\n\nThe vibe I picked from the *Perfect Memento* is that yōkai just so happen to not have anything against eating human meat.","artistId":"purabird","characterIds":["rumia"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"purabird","name":"ぷらばーど","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/purabird0370","portrait":"portraits/artists/purabird.webp","artworkCount":10,"characterCount":12},"characters":[{"id":"rumia","name":"Rumia","short_name":"Rumia","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/rumia.webp","artworkCount":33,"artistCount":22}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1d2j8hv","img":"https://i.redd.it/nsffv1fo263d1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1n65pdj","img":"https://i.redd.it/wmrjth9kenmf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1gnc25i","img":"https://i.redd.it/n5dv9mqs5wzd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mlt6h8","img":"https://i.redd.it/mkb2u2ltp0if1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1j2j1p2","nextPostId":"1j3a0gd"}}
