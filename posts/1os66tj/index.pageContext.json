Generally a bad outcome for the person who encounter her of the Joker's scars kind, depending on the telling.\n\nA popular deterrent would be a pomade – either shouting the word three times (or six times), actually applying a pomade, or any of the various usage of the concept – would deter her from attacking you. The explanation seems to be that in life, this woman had plastic surgery, and they used a lot of pomade on her. That is why she came to hate the smell.\n\nAnd of course, there's a variation that the pomade will actually make her angry, and she'll outright kill you instead of just slicing your cheeks.","artistId":"fumisetsu","characterIds":["sumireko","kokoro"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"fumisetsu","name":"ふみ切","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/papiermesser","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/heavy.webp","artworkCount":2,"characterCount":4},"characters":[{"id":"kokoro","name":"Hata no Kokoro","short_name":"Kokoro","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kokoro.webp","artworkCount":13,"artistCount":11},{"id":"sumireko","name":"Usami Sumireko","short_name":"Sumireko","work":["ulil"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sumireko.webp","artworkCount":8,"artistCount":5}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1p1xivk","img":"https://i.redd.it/c7xaem5mcd2g1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1ortax4","nextPostId":"1osds3m"}}
