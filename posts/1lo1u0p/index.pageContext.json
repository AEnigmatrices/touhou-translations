The relevant gist of *Aya no Tsuzumi* (*The Damask Drum*) is that a drum made from damask silk cannot make a sound – the old gardener was tricked, killed himself, and became an onryō.\n\nAnd **Sugawara no Michizane** is a really big name. He was a scholar and a politician, so you can guess that it's court intrigue (specifically the **Fujiwara** clan) that got him vengeful. Legend says that when he died, natural disasters struck. The imperial court posthumously restored his titles, reversed his exile, and even dedicated a shrine to him. Later on, he was deified to **Tenjin**, a very influential god even in modern days. People pray to him for good luck in exams.\n\nBy the way, when Michizane took his civil service examination, guess who examined him – **Miyako no Yoshika**.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["reimu","raiko","mizuchi","seija"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":266,"artistCount":115},{"id":"seija","name":"Kijin Seija","short_name":"Seija","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seija.webp","artworkCount":24,"artistCount":15},{"id":"raiko","name":"Horikawa Raiko","short_name":"Raiko","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/raiko.webp","artworkCount":5,"artistCount":5},{"id":"mizuchi","name":"Miyadeguchi Mizuchi","short_name":"Mizuchi","work":["fds"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/mizuchi.webp","artworkCount":27,"artistCount":11}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1om482p","img":"https://i.redd.it/q6z1glwmsqyf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lpzodg","img":"https://i.redd.it/kxge1exqhhaf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nqnshj","img":"https://i.redd.it/ktdf09e3qerf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mapyko","img":"https://i.redd.it/pc2evamiwfff1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1lntjtw","nextPostId":"1lobc4w"}}
