There's this goddess/demon called [**Kishimojin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hariti) in Japanese. She had hundreds of children. And to feed them, she kidnapped other people's children for her and her own to devour. The Buddha lectured her by kidnapping and hiding her youngest child.\n\nAfter the lecture, she vowed to only eat pomegranates instead of human flesh. This then gave rise to the comparison that **pomegranates taste like human flesh**.","artistId":"indo_sou","characterIds":["remilia","meiling"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"indo_sou","name":"インド僧","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/indozou","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/390501","portrait":"portraits/artists/indo_sou.webp","artworkCount":6,"characterCount":11},"characters":[{"id":"meiling","name":"Hong Meiling","short_name":"Meiling","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/meiling.webp","artworkCount":32,"artistCount":19},{"id":"remilia","name":"Remilia Scarlet","short_name":"Remilia","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/remilia.webp","artworkCount":108,"artistCount":53}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1k56sni","img":"https://i.redd.it/kkkf1ctm5ewe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jb3787","img":"https://i.redd.it/vdw8nq3vjnoe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kxga51","img":"https://i.redd.it/4hm9jlvyri3f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lg7oam","img":"https://i.redd.it/i75ebupqu38f1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1i496oq","nextPostId":"1i4yukt"}}
