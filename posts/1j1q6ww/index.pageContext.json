Like, Seiran and Ringo have always been around since not long after the barrier went up? Perhaps Eirin and Reisen later discovered this surveillance cell that they've always been living next to.\n\nIf we assume this stance, how much will it contradict the Imperishable Night lore?\n\n***\n\nOh shit. I just noticed. I saw the \"„É©\" and just assumed it's \"Rabbits\" ‚Äì but it's those two's \"„É©„É¥„Ç£\". It should be... **Ravi**? Actually, what is this supposed to even be? \"Ravi\" would be a direct transliteration. But for all we know, it could be \"Lavie\" too.\n\n\"La vie\" means \"the life\" in French, which I suppose kinda ties with how life is considered impure?\n\nAnother interpretation is that it's a sort of portmanteau for \"Rabbit\" and \"Navy\". You know, there's a lot of seas up there on the moon.\n\nAnd there's also this interpretation that it's a reference to [this game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feel_the_Magic:_XY/XX). The [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm0n4dTl3E8) has \"Rub it\" which seems to be a play on \"Love It\" and \"Rabbit\".\n\nYeah... I'll take that last assumption myself, in which case I'll stick with **Rabbit** lmao.","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["seiran","ringo"]},"artist":{"id":"shio","name":"„Åó„Åä","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shioshio1600","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2936205","portrait":"portraits/artists/shio.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"seiran","name":"Seiran","short_name":"Seiran","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seiran.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":7},{"id":"ringo","name":"Ringo","short_name":"Ringo","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ringo.webp","artworkCount":4,"artistCount":4}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1j796no","img":"https://i.redd.it/gly237t2gone1.png"},{"id":"1jtnwah","img":"https://i.redd.it/xzodawiikfte1.png"},{"id":"1liwoi6","img":"https://i.redd.it/nrgavj7tnr8f1.png"},{"id":"1nzd31d","img":"https://i.redd.it/wtqqqq9j7gtf1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1j112a9","nextPostId":"1j1r8w7"}}
