It is a distinct object, a legendary artifact if you will, that grants **clarity**. So it is a name... wait a minute...\n\nAh... I get it now. That there's the keyword, isn't it? Clarity. Enlightenment. Becoming pure to fit in better with the Pure Land. Like how Yuyuko and Y≈çmu could hung around there back in SSiB 'cause they're pure (you know, Meikai counts as a Pure Land).\n\nWait a second minute... the idea behind the cast is that local y≈çkai have no goddamn clue they're even being invaded, right? That explains the humans with Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae. But Reisen? So moon rabbits... aren't y≈çkai? ü§î This aligns with my theory still brewing in the pot that moon rabbits are genetically/spiritually modified humans, and they are the \"human village\" equivalent for the Lunar Capital.\n\nFinally, back to the translation point. The basis for my current argument is:\n- \"Hourai no Kusuri\" = H≈çrai Elixir.\n- \"Kanju no Kusuri\" = Ultramarine Orb Elixir??? ü§® Why not Kanju Elixir?","artistId":"mikazukimo","characterIds":["reisen","eirin","seiran"]},"artist":{"id":"mikazukimo","name":"„Éü„Ç´„ÉÖ„Ç≠„É¢","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/mikadukimo777","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/8543340","portrait":"portraits/artists/mikazukimo.webp","artworkCount":15,"characterCount":27},"characters":[{"id":"reisen","name":"Reisen Udongein Inaba","short_name":"Reisen","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reisen.webp","artworkCount":46,"artistCount":27},{"id":"eirin","name":"Yagokoro Eirin","short_name":"Eirin","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/eirin.webp","artworkCount":19,"artistCount":12},{"id":"seiran","name":"Seiran","short_name":"Seiran","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seiran.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":7}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1k94dwg","img":"https://i.redd.it/lh0xgmxytdxe1.png"},{"id":"1lkloh7","img":"https://i.redd.it/3egxrgx1x59f1.png"},{"id":"1jwq6w2","img":"https://i.redd.it/xaqfq729m7ue1.png"},{"id":"1if5qbr","img":"https://i.redd.it/ufiyu1uzyige1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1itxtgz","nextPostId":"1iu0hfi"}}
