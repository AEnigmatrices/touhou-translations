It is a distinct object, a legendary artifact if you will, that grants **clarity**. So it is a name... wait a minute...\n\nAh... I get it now. That there's the keyword, isn't it? Clarity. Enlightenment. Becoming pure to fit in better with the Pure Land. Like how Yuyuko and Yōmu could hung around there back in SSiB 'cause they're pure (you know, Meikai counts as a Pure Land).\n\nWait a second minute... the idea behind the cast is that local yōkai have no goddamn clue they're even being invaded, right? That explains the humans with Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae. But Reisen? So moon rabbits... aren't yōkai? 🤔 This aligns with my theory still brewing in the pot that moon rabbits are genetically/spiritually modified humans, and they are the \"human village\" equivalent for the Lunar Capital.\n\nFinally, back to the translation point. The basis for my current argument is:\n- \"Hourai no Kusuri\" = Hōrai Elixir.\n- \"Kanju no Kusuri\" = Ultramarine Orb Elixir??? 🤨 Why not Kanju Elixir?","artistId":"mikazukimo","characterIds":["reisen","eirin","seiran"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"mikazukimo","name":"ミカヅキモ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/mikadukimo777","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/8543340","portrait":"portraits/artists/mikazukimo.webp","artworkCount":27,"characterCount":38},"characters":[{"id":"reisen","name":"Reisen Udongein Inaba","short_name":"Reisen","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reisen.webp","artworkCount":60,"artistCount":34},{"id":"eirin","name":"Yagokoro Eirin","short_name":"Eirin","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/eirin.webp","artworkCount":32,"artistCount":18},{"id":"seiran","name":"Seiran","short_name":"Seiran","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seiran.webp","artworkCount":11,"artistCount":9}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1jdbyr4","img":"https://i.redd.it/yeoeaux0z8pe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jfqjws","img":"https://i.redd.it/rzwb17pdxupe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ncczn0","img":"https://i.redd.it/jdhn79l9j3of1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1oox3al","img":"https://i.redd.it/x5i733k4bezf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1itxtgz","nextPostId":"1iu0hfi"}}
