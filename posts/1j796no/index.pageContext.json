It basically means underling. This means she is subordinate to somebody. And not even like a petty officer kind. The word is really low. Rock bottom.\n\nOne angle I've seen is that she's subordinate to Aya (*Memories of Phantasm*), but I find that a bit unlikely. It feels like she's even lower than that. Like, she's really a grunt who has her own squad leader that she reports to.","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["momiji"]},"artist":{"id":"shio","name":"しお","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shioshio1600","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2936205","portrait":"portraits/artists/shio.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"momiji","name":"Inubashiri Momiji","short_name":"Momiji","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/momiji.webp","artworkCount":19,"artistCount":14}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1liwoi6","img":"https://i.redd.it/nrgavj7tnr8f1.png"},{"id":"1nzd31d","img":"https://i.redd.it/wtqqqq9j7gtf1.png"},{"id":"1ii9774","img":"https://i.redd.it/289au9ghhbhe1.png"},{"id":"1gfoirl","img":"https://i.redd.it/3aze4rc2rwxd1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1j77zsv","nextPostId":"1j7xt4m"}}
