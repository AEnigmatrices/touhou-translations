It basically means underling. This means she is subordinate to somebody. And not even like a petty officer kind. The word is really low. Rock bottom.\n\nOne angle I've seen is that she's subordinate to Aya (*Memories of Phantasm*), but I find that a bit unlikely. It feels like she's even lower than that. Like, she's really a grunt who has her own squad leader that she reports to.","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["momiji"]}}}
