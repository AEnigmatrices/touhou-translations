It basically means underling. This means she is subordinate to somebody. And not even like a petty officer kind. The word is really low. Rock bottom.\n\nOne angle I've seen is that she's subordinate to Aya (*Memories of Phantasm*), but I find that a bit unlikely. It feels like she's even lower than that. Like, she's really a grunt who has her own squad leader that she reports to.","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["momiji"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"shio","name":"しお","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shioshio1600","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2936205","portrait":"portraits/artists/shio.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"momiji","name":"Inubashiri Momiji","short_name":"Momiji","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/momiji.webp","artworkCount":24,"artistCount":18}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1jtnwah","img":"https://i.redd.it/xzodawiikfte1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1f8sgxc","img":"https://i.redd.it/e3kevyg2hsmd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1midbk0","img":"https://i.redd.it/mn6o8hpw58hf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1iwak1q","img":"https://i.redd.it/d4ragiqm8wke1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1j77zsv","nextPostId":"1j7xt4m"}}
