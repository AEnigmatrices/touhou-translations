Imagine one of the previous mikos having a purification **arquebus.**\n\n***\n\nSo this is a detail in *Double Dealing Character*. Before the fight in Stage 5, Seija actually asks Marisa and Sakuya to join the revolution. However, she doesn't ask Reimu.\n\nAnd it is also a partial reference to Seija's fortune slip. There is a fortune for \"Tools\" – Tools will never betray you. And thus to Seija, Reimu as Yukari's tool will never betray her.\n\nThough personally, I like to see Yukari as at best only an ally. The Hakurei is not subservient to the Yakumo in Gensōkyō's political spectrum. Reimu nominally serves the Hakurei God-Emperor, so... she really is a tool 🤔","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["reimu","seija"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":28,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":254,"artistCount":110},{"id":"seija","name":"Kijin Seija","short_name":"Seija","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seija.webp","artworkCount":23,"artistCount":14}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1opt4bo","img":"https://i.redd.it/xda8epdvflzf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mapyko","img":"https://i.redd.it/pc2evamiwfff1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nxo4mo","img":"https://i.redd.it/gxzhksdyx1tf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nm2bjg","img":"https://i.redd.it/jcu46rg0hcqf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1n45sjo","nextPostId":"1n4p0zt"}}
