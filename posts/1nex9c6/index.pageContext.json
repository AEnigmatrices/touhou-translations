The way I understand it, being reincarnated into a beast is bad in that you're totally driven by instinct and would be too fixated on survival to even consider the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nI think the general idea is that the Humanrealm is the most ideal realm to achieve enlightenment. You're too torturous as a being in Hell. You're too hungry as a Preta. You're too dumb as a Beast. You're too... emotional(?) as an Asura. And you're too happy as a Deva.","artistId":"ran","characterIds":["clownpiece","yachie","byakuren"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"ran","name":"らん","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/runker","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1105169","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/scout.webp","artworkCount":3,"characterCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"byakuren","name":"Hijiri Byakuren","short_name":"Byakuren","work":["ufo"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/byakuren.webp","artworkCount":35,"artistCount":28},{"id":"clownpiece","name":"Clownpiece","short_name":"Clownpiece","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/clownpiece.webp","artworkCount":11,"artistCount":8},{"id":"yachie","name":"Kicchō Yachie","short_name":"Yachie","work":["wbawc","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yachie.webp","artworkCount":17,"artistCount":16}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1hfjmzr","img":"https://i.redd.it/9osgqf81v77e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ejuiz3","img":"https://i.redd.it/q8aneztb9ngd1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1neon26","nextPostId":"1nf74wj"}}
