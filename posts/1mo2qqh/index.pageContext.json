While the kishin aren't formally under her beck and call, she is greatly respected and could get them to not march to the surface for the recent incident.\n\nPerhaps it may be the case that Zanmu's influence over Hell is about equal to Hecatia's. The Japanese half-oni has the ears of practically every oni in Hell and beyond. And the Anatolian triple god presumably has a monopoly in faith throughout the Hell.\n\nOr Hells? 🤨 Was the Former Hell all hells, or was just Earth's old Hell?","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["zanmu","hisami"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"shio","name":"しお","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shioshio1600","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2936205","portrait":"portraits/artists/shio.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"hisami","name":"Yomotsu Hisami","short_name":"Hisami","work":["udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/hisami.webp","artworkCount":8,"artistCount":7},{"id":"zanmu","name":"Nippaku Zanmu","short_name":"Zanmu","work":["udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/zanmu.webp","artworkCount":13,"artistCount":12}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1nzd31d","img":"https://i.redd.it/wtqqqq9j7gtf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ghy3q8","img":"https://i.redd.it/o3yclft84iyd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1gy17iu","img":"https://i.redd.it/zuzone2zyn2e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1liwoi6","img":"https://i.redd.it/nrgavj7tnr8f1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1mntiue","nextPostId":"1mocpxz"}}
