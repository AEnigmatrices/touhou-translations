This basically means \"great family\" – the clan ruling over a region. Put in Crusader Kings terms from the perspective of the ruling Imperial Family – landed vassals who are not of your dynasty. This only applies to Miko's contemporary, however, as the power structure later centralized, and those clans close to that center became the more familiar-sounding **Kizoku**.\n\nHuh... now I wonder what those three would think about the political landscape of, say, the Sengoku period almost a thousand years later? 'Cause by that point, the structure of the traditional nobility collapsed and the samurai warrior class pretty much took over. Though I suppose from their perspective, the samurai were simply not the Imperial Family, and thus in their eyes were simply Gōzoku all the same?\n\n🤔 **Zanmu** should visit and fill them in with her contemporary details.","artistId":"satsuki","characterIds":["tojiko","futo","miko","okina"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"satsuki","name":"皐","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Stk________","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/pyro.webp","artworkCount":5,"characterCount":5},"characters":[{"id":"tojiko","name":"Soga no Tojiko","short_name":"Tojiko","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/tojiko.webp","artworkCount":30,"artistCount":22},{"id":"futo","name":"Mononobe no Futo","short_name":"Futo","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/futo.webp","artworkCount":28,"artistCount":23},{"id":"miko","name":"Toyosatomimi no Miko","short_name":"Miko","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/miko.webp","artworkCount":45,"artistCount":28},{"id":"okina","name":"Matara Okina","short_name":"Okina","work":["hsifs"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/okina.webp","artworkCount":35,"artistCount":23}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1nagioi","img":"https://i.redd.it/bxlclshqannf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mqrass","img":"https://i.redd.it/lii14fdi45jf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1gb1wil","img":"https://i.redd.it/7y102m8abpwd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mu341f","img":"https://i.redd.it/2ktonl4rbvjf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1iuq5rq","nextPostId":"1iusrk7"}}
