Remember, it's not about finding the best answer, but more on how you reason your answer. Like, no – you're not supposed to derail the trolley and save everybody. And no – you're not supposed to kill everybody so the trolley kills nobody.\n\nPersonally, I see pulling the lever and not pulling lever as both conscious choices.
