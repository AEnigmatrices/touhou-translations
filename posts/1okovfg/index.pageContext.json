Yukari would have fit right in being a Geidontei semi-regular â€“ maybe having Miyoi make more classy drinks for her.\n\nCome to think of it, this kind of setting would have been so interesting. That instead of being a place for the regulars to discuss the events of the chapter, we have Geidontei as a more neutral establishment where many other characters get to interact with one another in such a setting. A ***Restaurant to Another World*** kind of vibe where ZUN may play around with different characters in a more flexible context.\n\nYeah, I like [***Purple Summit.***](https://mangadex.org/title/4a84ecda-e5be-42c8-bddf-c4c0dc8dbf5d/touhou-purple-summit)","artistId":"kakunoshin","characterIds":["reimu","miyoi"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"kakunoshin","name":"å²©æ´¥éš ä¹‹é€²","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Kakunoshin22","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":246,"artistCount":105},{"id":"miyoi","name":"Okunoda Miyoi","short_name":"Miyoi","work":["le"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/miyoi.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":9}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1okg96o","nextPostId":"1okyicu"}}
