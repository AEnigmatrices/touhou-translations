Reading her bio so far, it seems she's actually interested in the act of **stealing** the corpses, rather. Like, it's the souls that have just slipped out of their bodies that she wants to chase. Or something.\n\nOne key thing to note would be the fact that she does not dig up corpses. Properly buried bodies aren't in her radar for this hobby. And so, she's not a grave robber, but more like a funeral robber.\n\nAnd we can still maintain the collection aspect too in a way by saying instead of collecting bodies (because they all go into the furnace), she collects **souls**! And hell, if your soul gets stolen by a kasha, you become an onryō. ~~If Orin actually goes wayyy back, then Mizuchi quite possibly became a vengeful spirit because of her lmao.~~","artistId":"noai_nioshi","characterIds":["satori","orin"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"noai_nioshi","name":"野愛におし","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/nioshi_noai","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/246328","portrait":"portraits/artists/noai_nioshi.webp","artworkCount":14,"characterCount":5},"characters":[{"id":"satori","name":"Komeiji Satori","short_name":"Satori","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/satori.webp","artworkCount":44,"artistCount":30},{"id":"orin","name":"Kaenbyō Rin","short_name":"Orin","work":["sa","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/orin.webp","artworkCount":36,"artistCount":23}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1oerv2o","img":"https://i.redd.it/9muv2q70o0xf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1i6kd3l","img":"https://i.redd.it/6lcfxaib2dee1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lb4fzx","img":"https://i.redd.it/bgq1cpbh0v6f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1hru3q9","img":"https://i.redd.it/q0nzkcfa5lae1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1hvqqsc","nextPostId":"1hvt1rj"}}
