If I understand this correctly, the tax adjustment is just for your job. So if you have any other income – or want deductions not covered by the one filed by your employer – you'd still need to file a separate tax return.\n\nAs for the deduction certificate – again, if I understand this correctly – it's just a kind of common supporting documentation for a tax deduction. For instance, you'd get one from your insurance. The idea is that they're certificates specifically for claiming a tax deduction, as opposed to being simply proof of payment for something that happens to be eligible for a tax deduction.\n\nAnd March 15th is the deadline for filing the previous year's tax returns.","artistId":"konna_reshiki","characterIds":["tsukasa"]},"artist":{"id":"konna_reshiki","name":"紺奈れしき","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/konna_reshiki","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/79577634","portrait":"/portraits/artists/konna_reshiki.webp","artworkCount":5,"characterCount":7},"characters":[{"id":"tsukasa","name":"Kudamaki Tsukasa","short_name":"Tsukasa","work":["um","udoalg"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/tsukasa.webp","artworkCount":25,"artistCount":20}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1gzkr9k","img":"https://i.redd.it/qj2xwgv4b23e1.png"},{"id":"1f1q6d3","img":"https://i.redd.it/tnxm8t51v0ld1.png"},{"id":"1eujkf2","img":"https://i.redd.it/pjnxvg6rm8jd1.png"},{"id":"1ccqun2","img":"https://i.redd.it/n4fx6pwiemwc1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1gyq98z","nextPostId":"1gyt3iy"}}
