Huh... so initially the myth has a toad, but then it became rabbit? Does that imply she created the moon rabbits (it seems she's the leader?) and replaced the myth?\n\nAnd the toad is three-legged? A counterpart to the three-legged crow? So perhaps she's like Okū with Yatagarasu? That Jōga is not actually a toad, but she's got a toad in her?","artistId":"urashima","characterIds":["sagume"]},"artist":{"id":"urashima","name":"浦嶋","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/urashima0039","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/engineer.webp","artworkCount":2,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"sagume","name":"Kishin Sagume","short_name":"Sagume","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sagume.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":6}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mr277p","img":"https://i.redd.it/m2j72t3ui7jf1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1jsukld","nextPostId":"1jtlrqy"}}
