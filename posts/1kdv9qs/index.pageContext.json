But what if we move our focus to Remilia's lifespan instead? ü§î\n\n# I mean, if she's been around for 500 years, then Sakuya is basically like Remilia's sixteenth dog.\n\nI'm really digging the idea that Remilia had other maids prior to Sakuya, and she loved them all just as much. Except maybe Margaret, who craved garlic out of all things while she was pregnant, and still kept peeling more after she had popped them out. Still, one hell of a cook though, probably the best in the estate's history. Sakuya still has a long way to go to match old Marge's spotted dick. Bitch never wrote down her recipes, and took them with her to the grave.\n\nOne time Remilia called Reimu over to be a medium in exchange for Meiling's helping hand fixing some stairs leading to the shrine ‚Äì had to throw in a free supper too to make her accept the deal. Apparently, a s√©ance is considered out-of-line here in Gens≈çky≈ç, and Remilia got chewed out by Eiki for that (and continued with Reimu through the dinner). Remilia did get a few sentences though. An actual dead man's leg.
