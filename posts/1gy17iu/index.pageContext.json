The idea is basically spelling out her full name with the addition of the \"To\" between the \"Assari\", writing out **Komeiji** As**sa**(**to**)**ri** – **こめいじ** あっ**さ**(**と**)**り**.\n- The Stare! part is another pun. A word for scolding is \"Omedama\" (お**目**玉) which has \"**eye**\" in it. So this compounds with how Satori has a third eye and is staring at her pet here.\n- Not sure about the Mistresses actually. What I'm assuming is that **主** can be used like an adjective that's basically the equivalent of the word \"**Primary**\". So, like, it's supposed to be, say, \"**Main Scolding**\", but with the context we know that the character is referring to **Mistress**.\n- Shio loves puns.","artistId":"shio","characterIds":["satori"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"shio","name":"しお","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shioshio1600","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2936205","portrait":"portraits/artists/shio.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"satori","name":"Komeiji Satori","short_name":"Satori","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/satori.webp","artworkCount":48,"artistCount":32}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1dqixxt","img":"https://i.redd.it/qbvqtnst7b9d1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jcn2du","img":"https://i.redd.it/k1z0kjn1e2pe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1midbk0","img":"https://i.redd.it/mn6o8hpw58hf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1iae3u3","img":"https://i.redd.it/n15aziqp7cfe1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1gxzz15","nextPostId":"1gyq98z"}}
