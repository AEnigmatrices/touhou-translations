The cycle is that once the Miare dies, they work in hell for decades until a new body for the next reincarnation is ready. Prolonging it might be equivalent to messing with the schedule. Maybe this involved Eirin sending Reisen through bureaucratic hell in order to change it.\n\nEven the great Omoikane of the Shinto cannot hope to overcome the much more established cycle of transmigration. Even the Hōrai Elixir to the bureaucrats of Hell is just a matter of technicality. In the end, all will die and be born again.\n\nHuh... this also means Eiki, and quite possibly Komachi and Kutaka too, would've been very acquainted with the previous incarnations of Akyū – remember, Akyū doesn't actually retain memories of her past lives that are unrelated to the chronicles.","artistId":"shay","characterIds":["akyuu","kosuzu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"shay","name":"シェイ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/ShayyyTeraO","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/67949568","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/spy.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"akyuu","name":"Hieda no Akyū","short_name":"Akyū","work":["pmiss"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/akyuu.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":6},{"id":"kosuzu","name":"Motōri Kosuzu","short_name":"Kosuzu","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kosuzu.webp","artworkCount":12,"artistCount":11}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mnh52o","img":"https://i.redd.it/dlz47qldzeif1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1hjcipd","img":"https://i.redd.it/eti5mzit388e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1n4p0zt","img":"https://i.redd.it/mc6b0umsabmf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1o6jllu","nextPostId":"1o750s9"}}
