I guess I can kinda use the EoSD Extra stage to support my argument. Like, why did Reimu/Marisa face just Patchouli when Flandre was out and about? 🤔 What was Sakuya doing? Hiding somewhere?\n\nMeiling I can imagine going out trying to contain Flandre early on as the first line of defense, but Sakuya too? Did Flandre really beat both of them up just before Reimu/Marisa arrived? Well, I suppose that scenario would also be interesting – that Flandre was already pretty winded after fighting Meiling and Sakuya (and maybe Koakuma too). The Extra Stage was easy Flandre 'cause the servants already softened her up.\n\nAnd Patchouli was about to go up next and make her stand when Reimu/Marisa showed up. Why was she feeling a little better that day? 'Cause she just took her stimulants!","artistId":"ebi","characterIds":["sakuya","flandre"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"ebi","name":"えび","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/hua88331","portrait":"portraits/artists/ebi.webp","artworkCount":28,"characterCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"sakuya","name":"Izayoi Sakuya","short_name":"Sakuya","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sakuya.webp","artworkCount":105,"artistCount":57},{"id":"flandre","name":"Flandre Scarlet","short_name":"Flandre","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/flandre.webp","artworkCount":94,"artistCount":60}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1m9ntit","img":"https://i.redd.it/h75fl619e6ff1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1k25g8h","img":"https://i.redd.it/ucciaeiamlve1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1n124i9","img":"https://i.redd.it/8rbtga0pdglf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1m5mtpd","img":"https://i.redd.it/1coyw08y29ef1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1es0s36","nextPostId":"1esudmv"}}
