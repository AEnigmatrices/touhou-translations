Or novice? What's the term for it if it's Buddhism... wait, which Buddhism are we even talking about here?\n\nIf I recall correctly, one of the minor details about Myōrenji oft repeated is that we're not exactly sure which Buddhist sect this temple is. Like, while Shingon Buddhism is a pretty solid guess – it's just as likely that the temple practices Byakuren's own brand of Esoteric Buddhism.\n\nHmm... initially I had a feeling that Ichirin meant it's her garb that she's personally lending to Jo'on's to wear. But the idea that it's temple property that reasonably should be handled with care anyway is also pretty logical.","artistId":"hawatari","characterIds":["joon","byakuren","kyouko","nue","minamitsu","kokoro","koishi","ichirin","shou","nazrin"]}}}
