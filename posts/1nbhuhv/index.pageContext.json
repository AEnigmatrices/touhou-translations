While mighty yōkai specialize in one way or another, Meiling is a **generalist** with her qi manipulation. Perhaps this manifests in various effects that will catch her opponents off guard – every strong yōkai has a weakness or ten, and this jill-of-all-trades has many tricks up her sleeves to exploit all of them. All the colors and all the flowers are just a little part of what she's truly capable of with her qi.","artistId":"migisune","characterIds":["meiling"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"migisune","name":"右脛","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/ukei624","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":5,"characterCount":3},"characters":[{"id":"meiling","name":"Hong Meiling","short_name":"Meiling","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/meiling.webp","artworkCount":32,"artistCount":19}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1okg96o","img":"https://i.redd.it/sjvjf6wsbcyf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kn8qm6","img":"https://i.redd.it/m4k6i8ktay0f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kz4rhd","img":"https://i.redd.it/yzbbkgnjcx3f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1obg7xf","img":"https://i.redd.it/ku3wn3vh29wf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1nb9ird","nextPostId":"1nbrt7j"}}
