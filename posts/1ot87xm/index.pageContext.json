Like, she's not gonna be pissed if you're just minding your own business picking and freezing flowers.\n\nFor all we know, she probably just enjoys slow walks surrounded by the flowers blooming by her power. She wouldn't mind you picking one or two when she can easily grow ten more in that same timespan.\n\nBut still, that wherever she goes becomes a flower field is such a powerful image.","artistId":"iroiro_yaru_hito","characterIds":["yuuka"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"iroiro_yaru_hito","name":"いろいろやる人","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/iro2do","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1341860","portrait":"portraits/artists/iroiro_yaru_hito.webp","artworkCount":19,"characterCount":25},"characters":[{"id":"yuuka","name":"Kazami Yūka","short_name":"Yūka","work":["pofv"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuuka.webp","artworkCount":14,"artistCount":10}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1d119k8","img":"https://i.redd.it/mon8m9buur2d1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o54uqm","img":"https://i.redd.it/u3d7yaupsruf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o0iv86","img":"https://i.redd.it/zegn3zd8qptf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1j43ivh","img":"https://i.redd.it/m483ju64mvme1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1osz21o","nextPostId":"1othm3q"}}
