So we're dealing with the gender-neutral \"men\" case. And switching to \"honest people\" sounds really off.\n\nAnd this **者** is a really convenient character, by the way. It's pretty much the \"**-er**\" in English. For instance, \"採掘\" is \"mining\", and appending it into \"採掘者\" makes it \"miner\".\n\nBut \"honester\" is not how we refer to an honest person, is it?","artistId":"sannoji","characterIds":["tewi","aya","seiga","nue","yachie","futo","tsukasa"]}}}
