So we're dealing with the gender-neutral \"men\" case. And switching to \"honest people\" sounds really off.\n\nAnd this **者** is a really convenient character, by the way. It's pretty much the \"**-er**\" in English. For instance, \"採掘\" is \"mining\", and appending it into \"採掘者\" makes it \"miner\".\n\nBut \"honester\" is not how we refer to an honest person, is it?","artistId":"sannoji","characterIds":["flandre","tewi","aya","seiga","nue","yachie","futo","tsukasa"]},"artist":{"id":"sannoji","name":"三ノ字","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/3WD_TKM","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/heavy.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":17},"characters":[{"id":"flandre","name":"Flandre Scarlet","short_name":"Flandre","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/flandre.webp","artworkCount":61,"artistCount":40},{"id":"tewi","name":"Inaba Tewi","short_name":"Tewi","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/tewi.webp","artworkCount":18,"artistCount":14},{"id":"aya","name":"Shameimaru Aya","short_name":"Aya","work":["pofv","sa","mof","ds"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/aya.webp","artworkCount":57,"artistCount":28},{"id":"nue","name":"Hōjū Nue","short_name":"Nue","work":["ufo"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/nue.webp","artworkCount":14,"artistCount":9},{"id":"seiga","name":"Kaku Seiga","short_name":"Seiga","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seiga.webp","artworkCount":15,"artistCount":12},{"id":"futo","name":"Mononobe no Futo","short_name":"Futo","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/futo.webp","artworkCount":20,"artistCount":18},{"id":"yachie","name":"Kicchō Yachie","short_name":"Yachie","work":["wbawc","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yachie.webp","artworkCount":11,"artistCount":11},{"id":"tsukasa","name":"Kudamaki Tsukasa","short_name":"Tsukasa","work":["um","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/tsukasa.webp","artworkCount":28,"artistCount":22}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1g1zu40","img":"https://i.redd.it/8meuvwsvrbud1.png"},{"id":"1lmhfx1","img":"https://i.redd.it/ezn0fbiikm9f1.png"},{"id":"1m2nhrx","img":"https://i.redd.it/w8ufnwb0xidf1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1gzkr9k","nextPostId":"1h0cea6"}}
