The yamanba respect this kind of seniority, but that seems to be the extent of it. All of them by definition keep to themselves, to each their own.\n\nThough she seems to style herself as the leading figure, she does actually work to keep the sanctuary the way it is, so the reclusive locals love her. And so her leadership stems from that kind of charismatic popularity rather than any sort of established contract.\n\nJust because yamanba are solitary by nature doesn't mean they are utterly incapable of collective action though, right? I can imagine Ubame doing exactly this in the past when maybe the tengu or some other faction decided to encroach on their territory.\n\n***\"We gotta teach 'em another lesson, y'all!\"***\n\nMaybe they once decimated the tengu and rampaged across Yōkai Mountain before. And maybe they almost accidentally discovered Eientei while chasing rabbits.","artistId":"shope","characterIds":["ubame"]},"artist":{"id":"shope","name":"しょぺ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/syope","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/90634","portrait":"portraits/artists/shope.webp","artworkCount":6,"characterCount":10},"characters":[{"id":"ubame","name":"Chirizuka Ubame","short_name":"Ubame","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ubame.webp","artworkCount":6,"artistCount":6}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lcwsaw","img":"https://i.redd.it/ijvtywhtbb7f1.png"},{"id":"1npsk20","img":"https://i.redd.it/w0ws7tokf7rf1.gif"},{"id":"1lc3t3a","img":"https://i.redd.it/6r14vj8h647f1.png"},{"id":"1jl385z","img":"https://i.redd.it/euswe40yb8re1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1l740k7","nextPostId":"1l76wky"}}
