There are a lot of kamis who are also ichigami – famous names like Daikoku-sama revered by the Earth Rabbits, Ebisu, Inari, Jizō... Despite that, however, I still hold my candle for the theory. I do love the prospect that **both of Sakuya's older sisters have revealed themselves in Gensōkyō.**\n\nAnother thing would be the [**Hare and Ke.**](https://kuon.tokyo/blogs/blog/hare-and-ke) Fan translations seem to have gone with Chimata being a \"god of revelry\", which I personally think it's a bit off. Hare and Ke are specific concepts in Japanese – the special and the mundane. Hence, I believe transliterating it like Yin and Yang would be more appropriate.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["yuiman","ariya","chimata"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"chimata","name":"Tenkyū Chimata","short_name":"Chimata","work":["um"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/chimata.webp","artworkCount":16,"artistCount":13},{"id":"yuiman","name":"Yuiman Asama","short_name":"Yuiman","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuiman.webp","artworkCount":25,"artistCount":15},{"id":"ariya","name":"Iwanaga Ariya","short_name":"Ariya","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ariya.webp","artworkCount":29,"artistCount":15}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1nxxtck","img":"https://i.redd.it/5k0cdagdb4tf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lzqcp0","img":"https://i.redd.it/y4hfigmu4vcf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1om482p","img":"https://i.redd.it/q6z1glwmsqyf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kv1sd8","img":"https://i.redd.it/cwhk8ii6dx2f1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1o3qgjq","nextPostId":"1o4d76f"}}
