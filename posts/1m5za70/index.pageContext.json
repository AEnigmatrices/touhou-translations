On the off chance that there are no other yūrei whatsoever to fill in for Yōmu on her day off, I suppose Yuyuko – or the steward of the estate – would have to hire a couple of extra hands. Hmm...\n\n- Yūka might just be a regular visiting the gardens, and would be a natural pick to look after them for some time, though most likely with a very different vision than Yōmu.\n- Yuyuko has definitely fought Tenshi before, and she might be impressed by tennin swordsmanship. Coaching a ghost princess might be something Tenshi find interesting. She's sensitive to death though as a tennin. But on the other hand, Meikai is a pure land, meaning it is far removed from death. What's her relationship with Yuyuko on this front? 🤨","artistId":"teoi","characterIds":["youmu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"teoi","name":"健康な手負い","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/MATEO2023_ex","portrait":"portraits/artists/teoi.webp","artworkCount":17,"characterCount":15},"characters":[{"id":"youmu","name":"Konpaku Yōmu","short_name":"Yōmu","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/youmu.webp","artworkCount":44,"artistCount":26}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lmqb5z","img":"https://i.redd.it/xh352273yo9f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kkrspq","img":"https://i.redd.it/94lpyajylc0f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1oqy9ov","img":"https://i.redd.it/hwwjflohyuzf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1f9oczm","img":"https://i.redd.it/1ss6u7mz70nd1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1m5mtpd","nextPostId":"1m68aiw"}}
