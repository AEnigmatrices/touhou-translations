On the off chance that there are no other yūrei whatsoever to fill in for Yōmu on her day off, I suppose Yuyuko – or the steward of the estate – would have to hire a couple of extra hands. Hmm...\n\n- Yūka might just be a regular visiting the gardens, and would be a natural pick to look after them for some time, though most likely with a very different vision than Yōmu.\n- Yuyuko has definitely fought Tenshi before, and she might be impressed by tennin swordsmanship. Coaching a ghost princess might be something Tenshi find interesting. She's sensitive to death though as a tennin. But on the other hand, Meikai is a pure land, meaning it is far removed from death.
