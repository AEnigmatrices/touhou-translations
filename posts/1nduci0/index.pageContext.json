I mean, conventional magic. Witches. Magical girls. She's an outside world girl, so like us, she should be at least intrigued by this even if she's supernatural herself – and Marisa would be a perfect person to approach, or at least have her introduce to more witches.\n\nImagine Marisa introducing Sanae to Alice and Patchouli right after *Mountain of Faith.* And maybe a few more unnamed witches too. Yeah, there are definitely more out there that Marisa is friends with.","artistId":"yamori","characterIds":["marisa","sanae"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yamori","name":"やもり","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yamoyamo0909","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"marisa","name":"Kirisame Marisa","short_name":"Marisa","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/marisa.webp","artworkCount":146,"artistCount":69},{"id":"sanae","name":"Kochiya Sanae","short_name":"Sanae","work":["mof","sa","ufo","soku","td","lolk","um","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sanae.webp","artworkCount":61,"artistCount":39}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1ndi9xz","nextPostId":"1ne32fm"}}
