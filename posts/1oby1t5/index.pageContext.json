And additional note that I'm guessing at this point that this contrasts with the \"gloomy\" 陰 – basically Hina's a socially awkward introvert.\n\nAnd finally, there's a little nuance with the Ms. Kagiyama. The specific phrase is \"Kagiyama-shi\". The 氏 is very formal. Like if it's in English, a -san would just be a friendly, respectful tone. Using -shi here is equivalent to actually calling another person Miss/Mister like it's a conference or something. The idea is that Hina awkwardly called Nitori \"Ms. Kawashiro\" and Nitori genuinely replied back with \"Ms. Kagiyama\" – and they've been stuck with that ever since.","artistId":"iroiro_yaru_hito","characterIds":["hina","nitori"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"iroiro_yaru_hito","name":"いろいろやる人","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/iro2do","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1341860","portrait":"portraits/artists/iroiro_yaru_hito.webp","artworkCount":14,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"hina","name":"Kagiyama Hina","short_name":"Hina","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/hina.webp","artworkCount":5,"artistCount":5},{"id":"nitori","name":"Kawashiro Nitori","short_name":"Nitori","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/nitori.webp","artworkCount":12,"artistCount":10}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1cj7tzi","img":"https://i.redd.it/b0ndqmkpj7yc1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1fxigey","img":"https://i.redd.it/jivp625th5td1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ntzw8y","img":"https://i.redd.it/bi640d9xd7sf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o0iv86","img":"https://i.redd.it/zegn3zd8qptf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1obg7xf","nextPostId":"1oc728i"}}
