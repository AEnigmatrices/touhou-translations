There's only one, and only one place I can think of, where her hair is that distinctive orange hue â€“ her portraits in the three fighting games. She's closer to blonde in every other official appearance. Just look at *UDoALG* for instance.\n\nMakes me think ZUN lowkey doesn't like the orange hair lmao.","artistId":"rose_gardena","characterIds":["suika"]}}}
