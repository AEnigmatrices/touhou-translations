There's only one, and only one place I can think of, where her hair is that distinctive orange hue – her portraits in the three fighting games.

Just look at *UDoALG* for instance.\n\nMakes me think ZUN lowkey doesn't like the orange hair lmao.","artistId":"rose_gardena","characterIds":["suika"]},"artist":{"id":"rose_gardena","name":"ろーずがーでな","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/ikatyusya","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/6627849","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":2,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"suika","name":"Ibuki Suika","short_name":"Suika","work":["iamp","swr","sa","soku","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/suika.webp","artworkCount":17,"artistCount":15}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lhj8ki","img":"https://i.redd.it/typjfcqdyf8f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1fzqltb","nextPostId":"1g0i1du"}}
