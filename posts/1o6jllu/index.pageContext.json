But still 🤨 I've never imagined it to be **that** young...\n\nAnd given a young Sakuya, it's almost always Meiling who's the babysitter, isn't it? 🤔 But if it were me... Meiling should have her hands for already as the outdoorsman. And with this age point, it wouldn't be an elder figure, but more like a **mother** figure... Can you imagine if it's **Patchouli?** And she's the one who gave Sakuya the spacetime magic. Hell, maybe Patchouli was the original housekeeper using her magic with enchanted brooms and shit to keep the mansion clean before Sakuya took over.\n\nOn the other side of this spectrum, there's also the theory that in *EoSD,* Sakuya had literally just started working there.","artistId":"inukoro","characterIds":["sakuya","remilia"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"inukoro","name":"戌足","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/inu_inukor","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/scout.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"sakuya","name":"Izayoi Sakuya","short_name":"Sakuya","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sakuya.webp","artworkCount":93,"artistCount":51},{"id":"remilia","name":"Remilia Scarlet","short_name":"Remilia","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/remilia.webp","artworkCount":106,"artistCount":51}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1o69ijf","nextPostId":"1o6w2zt"}}
