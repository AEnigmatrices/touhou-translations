Hiyashi Tomato is, well, just chilled tomato. Sashimi is raw fish. Gesoage is deep-fried squid tentacles. Hiyayakko is cold tofu. And edamame is boiled/steamed green soybeans.\n\nAnd yeah, it seems there are different types to izakayas too, and \"taishū\" is the cheap and accessible kind.","artistId":"kamaya_kanatan","characterIds":["lunasa","merlin","lyrica","koishi","yatsuhashi","miyoi","nareko","chimi"]},"artist":{"id":"kamaya_kanatan","name":"釜屋 かなたん","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/kanatan1_31","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/6733559","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/sniper.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"lunasa","name":"Lunasa Prismriver","short_name":"Lunasa","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/lunasa.webp","artworkCount":5,"artistCount":4},{"id":"merlin","name":"Merlin Prismriver","short_name":"Merlin","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/merlin.webp","artworkCount":6,"artistCount":6},{"id":"lyrica","name":"Lyrica Prismriver","short_name":"Lyrica","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/lyrica.webp","artworkCount":5,"artistCount":4},{"id":"koishi","name":"Komeiji Koishi","short_name":"Koishi","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/koishi.webp","artworkCount":45,"artistCount":27},{"id":"yatsuhashi","name":"Tsukumo Yatsuhashi","short_name":"Yatsuhashi","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yatsuhashi.webp","artworkCount":1,"artistCount":1},{"id":"miyoi","name":"Okunoda Miyoi","short_name":"Miyoi","work":["le"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/miyoi.webp","artworkCount":8,"artistCount":7},{"id":"chimi","name":"Hōjū Chimi","short_name":"Chimi","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/chimi.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":7},{"id":"nareko","name":"Michigami Nareko","short_name":"Nareko","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/nareko.webp","artworkCount":19,"artistCount":15}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1l76wky","nextPostId":"1l7zn5w"}}
