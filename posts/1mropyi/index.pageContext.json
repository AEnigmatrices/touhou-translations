I've mentioned this earlier, but canonically despite the popular depiction of being a shut-in, Kaguya's really good at holding a conversation.\n\nNot to mention that in both [***Shoot the Bullet***](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Shoot_the_Bullet/Spell_Cards/Level_9#:~:text=新難題「金閣寺の一枚天井」) and [***Grimoire of Marisa***](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/The_Grimoire_of_Marisa/Kaguya_Houraisan's_Spell_Cards#:~:text=「金閣寺の一枚天井」), we know that Kaguya also has a very physical quality to her with her rather noteworthy spell card using an artifact called the \"**Seamless Ceiling of Kinkakuji**\". The idea of this spell card is that it's this gigantic piece of ceiling board that she holds with both hands and slams her opponent with it. Yes. Straight out of a cartoon. Imagine Mokō straight-up flattened by that.\n\nAnd it seems to be considered one of the most difficult spell cards in the game? Anyway, the myth seems to be that the ceiling of the top level of Kinkakuji is one single board. But in reality, it's a building technique with multiple ceiling panels that makes it look like it's just one panel.","artistId":"tofuya","characterIds":["kaguya"]},"artist":{"id":"tofuya","name":"と〜ふや","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Otofu_seller","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/23151908","portrait":"portraits/artists/tofuya.webp","artworkCount":28,"characterCount":26},"characters":[{"id":"kaguya","name":"Hōraisan Kaguya","short_name":"Kaguya","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kaguya.webp","artworkCount":31,"artistCount":12}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1me5q1b","img":"https://i.redd.it/olzd5bcnh8gf1.png"},{"id":"1ixwxm9","img":"https://i.redd.it/hi12tozsuale1.png"},{"id":"1jwvu1d","img":"https://i.redd.it/jbd07pq1t8ue1.png"},{"id":"1juftsv","img":"https://i.redd.it/fhy4ytgimmte1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1mrf4mw","nextPostId":"1mrzdvj"}}
