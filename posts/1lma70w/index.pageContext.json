So while still Mahayana like Byakuren, it's a whole different school of thought – both stemmed from China though, Zhēnyán and Línjì.\n\nHuh... Reimu's ability to fly in the \"air\" is actually really special. 空 can also mean emptiness in a philosophical context. It is impermanence. It is detachment. Reimu's true ability is not flight. It is to not be bound by anything. Kinda like the Heroes of *The Elder Scrolls*. Or Xiaoli from *Baki*.\n\nAnd then we contrast Reimu's impermanent void with Zanmu's nihilistic void.","artistId":"ikanoshigai","characterIds":["reimu","zanmu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"ikanoshigai","name":"ikanoshigai","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/ikanoshigai","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/soldier.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":262,"artistCount":112},{"id":"zanmu","name":"Nippaku Zanmu","short_name":"Zanmu","work":["udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/zanmu.webp","artworkCount":13,"artistCount":12}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1llxlmd","nextPostId":"1lmhfx1"}}
