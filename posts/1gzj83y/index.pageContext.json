Well, isn't it a bit odd that Nue calls both Reimu and Sanae \"little girl\", but calls [**Marisa**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Undefined_Fantastic_Object/Story/Marisa_A%27s_Extra) an \"unidentified human\"?\n\n**ENCYCLOPEDIA** \\[Challenging: Success\\] – If we break down the word, it's \"Shōtai\" (True Form) and \"Fumei\" (Unknown). So does that mean... Marisa is a \"Human whose true form is unknown\" ?\n\n**LOGIC** \\[Trivial: Success\\] – It seems Nue can tell that something is making Marisa \"unidentifiable\". Something is hiding Marisa's identity.\n\n**INLAND EMPIRE** \\[Easy: Success\\] – Keine? Did she eat Marisa's history?\n\n**SHIVERS** \\[Formidable: Success\\] – An air of quiet circulates the classroom, slowly picking up the smell of freshly ground ink and unfurled paper. The desks are slightly askew, as if young, eager hands have already begun to stir the day's lessons. The teacher stands at the front, poised, reviewing the choreography that she has performed time and again for many generations. She gives out a brief sigh. The farmer's daughter will probably receive another headbutt today, just like her mother.","artistId":"sha_re","characterIds":["nue"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"sha_re","name":"洒落","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/shiya_re04","portrait":"portraits/artists/sha_re.webp","artworkCount":15,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"nue","name":"Hōjū Nue","short_name":"Nue","work":["ufo"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/nue.webp","artworkCount":19,"artistCount":12}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mcffcl","img":"https://i.redd.it/4sa74ats6uff1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kgzl4e","img":"https://i.redd.it/7opwdwmfkdze1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kj9ods","img":"https://i.redd.it/9uhyqc6kcyze1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1gr42sz","img":"https://i.redd.it/qf9dgswc6v0e1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1gzi4pg","nextPostId":"1gzkr9k"}}
