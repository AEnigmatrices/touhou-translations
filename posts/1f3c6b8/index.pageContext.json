I mean, that translation doesn't fit with the convention as far as I know.\n\nTake the famous incident Oda Nobunaga was killed for instance. It's not called \"Honnō Temple\". It's called \"Honnōji\". Another famous tourist example would be the golden one. It's not \"Kinkaku Temple\". It's \"Kinkakuji\".","artistId":"gunjokikai","characterIds":["patchouli","shou"]},"artist":{"id":"gunjokikai","name":"鴨居能嵎","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/harisuwa","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/soldier.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"patchouli","name":"Patchouli Knowledge","short_name":"Patchouli","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/patchouli.webp","artworkCount":32,"artistCount":25},{"id":"shou","name":"Toramaru Shō","short_name":"Shō","work":["ufo"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/shou.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":8}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1f39gb1","nextPostId":"1f41lu8"}}
