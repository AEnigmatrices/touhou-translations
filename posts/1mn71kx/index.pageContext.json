I'm opting for \"Kyūten Falls\". I want it to fit the convention. You know, Niagara Falls and Angel Falls and all that. I got stuck a bit in a rabbit hole on whether it's \"Nine Heavens\" or \"Ninth Heaven\". But then I figured transliterating it would be the best choice. I mean, sure there's \"of\" in the name, but that's just how it goes with the waterfall names in Japanese.\n\nAnyway, I really like the idea that the colors do not correspond to social rank, but are just organizational divisions. Like, Aya and Momiji are part of the same \"company\", while Hatate and Megumu belong in different \"companies\".\n\nAnd \"Hokora\" is basically a small Shinto shrine.","artistId":"koyane","characterIds":["momiji"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"koyane","name":"児屋","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Silver81106","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1225841","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"momiji","name":"Inubashiri Momiji","short_name":"Momiji","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/momiji.webp","artworkCount":21,"artistCount":15}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mtfu9x","img":"https://i.redd.it/9xuzr8mxiqjf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1na3837","img":"https://i.redd.it/3ksr7kgthknf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mypr8y","img":"https://i.redd.it/lsl8fadfcxkf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1mmy8c5","nextPostId":"1mnh52o"}}
