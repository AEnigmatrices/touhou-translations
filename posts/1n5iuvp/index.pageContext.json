That she deconstructs your head and takes the initiative over your own conversation topics. You don't as much talk with her, but just listen to her as she easily strikes down any part of it that she doesn't agree with.\n\nMaybe I just love that little detail in *Memories of Phantasm* too much, when Yukari outright refused to join the party when Satori's around. Remember, her title is that even onryō are scared of her. If she gets serious, she will strip your heart and soul down to nothing less than total submission to her authority.","artistId":"shigure","characterIds":["satori"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"shigure","name":"時雨","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/sigure0210","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/81295706","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":10,"characterCount":9},"characters":[{"id":"satori","name":"Komeiji Satori","short_name":"Satori","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/satori.webp","artworkCount":45,"artistCount":30}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1no2psj","img":"https://i.redd.it/d84t3sgk2tqf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1n26bdl","img":"https://i.redd.it/ucnn2aelwplf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o8vdi3","img":"https://i.redd.it/7h5mjfampmvf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1grwsqx","img":"https://i.redd.it/mrw8mgbql21e1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1n5a2ub","nextPostId":"1n5smkc"}}
