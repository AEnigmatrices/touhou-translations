While it may be argued that she's a actually a pet – well, so is Reisen.\n- **Shō** is weird, to quote how Akyū puts it. She is Byakuren's disciple. So she would conventionally count as a servant to Byakuren (for one, she takes care of the temple when Byakuren's out). And yet at the same time, she's an avatar of Bishamonten. Byakuren worships Bishamonten. She wouldn't conventionally count as Byakuren's servant since Byakuren worships her as Bishamonten's proxy.\n- **Futo** is pretty much Miko's vassal, so she is her servant in a way.\n- **Clownpiece** is Hecatia's servant.\n- **Mai** and **Satono** are Okina's servants.\n- **Mayumi** is Keiki's servant.\n- **Megumu** is... also technically a servant if we look at it from the hierarchy stance like Futo. Her superior is Tenma. I think we may also argue that for UM, it should have been **Tsukasa** (who is certainly a servant) as the one who's supposed to be the Stage 5 boss, but Megumu jumped in.\n\nIn a way and very fittingly, **Seija** is the odd one out here.","artistId":"tofuya","characterIds":["reimu","marisa","sakuya","reisen","sanae","youmu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"tofuya","name":"と〜ふや","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Otofu_seller","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/23151908","portrait":"portraits/artists/tofuya.webp","artworkCount":31,"characterCount":29},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":269,"artistCount":116},{"id":"marisa","name":"Kirisame Marisa","short_name":"Marisa","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/marisa.webp","artworkCount":155,"artistCount":74},{"id":"sakuya","name":"Izayoi Sakuya","short_name":"Sakuya","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sakuya.webp","artworkCount":100,"artistCount":56},{"id":"youmu","name":"Konpaku Yōmu","short_name":"Yōmu","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/youmu.webp","artworkCount":44,"artistCount":26},{"id":"reisen","name":"Reisen Udongein Inaba","short_name":"Reisen","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reisen.webp","artworkCount":59,"artistCount":33},{"id":"sanae","name":"Kochiya Sanae","short_name":"Sanae","work":["mof","sa","ufo","soku","td","lolk","um","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sanae.webp","artworkCount":67,"artistCount":41}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1me5q1b","img":"https://i.redd.it/olzd5bcnh8gf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kz3jwj","img":"https://i.redd.it/nzsw6a8w2x3f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1l1hg8b","img":"https://i.redd.it/868apoleii4f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mp8n0t","img":"https://i.redd.it/tobu4gib9tif1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1kds9pv","nextPostId":"1kdv9qs"}}
