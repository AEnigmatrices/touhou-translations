Like, I think it means she needs to actively control it, as opposed to being an independent shadow clone.\n\n🤔 Wait a minute, how did the other body guard the shrine during *UDoALG* assuming that she has to actively control it?\n\n🤨 Huh? Aunn literally just told Yachie that there's two of her. She didn't even say that her other half was at the shrine... And controlling two different bodies doing totally different things? No way she can do that if a danmaku combination is already tiring for her. Her other body wouldn't have been able to do shit anyway. But... if Yachie also doesn't know that...\n\n😲 It's a f#cking bluff! Aunn really tricked Yachie!\n\n🫢 Or was she really using 200% of her brain controlling two bodies at the same time?!","artistId":"gakubuchi_udon","characterIds":["reimu","aun"]}}}
