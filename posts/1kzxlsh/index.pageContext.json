Given the relationship, the husband must politically align with the neutral Hakurei ‚Äì so the man must pretty much serve the Hakurei clan. No need to be an exterminator though. That's Reimu's job.\n\nReimu already handles the spiritual aspects of the Hakurei Shrine ‚Äì indeed, despite all her laziness, she does follow through when it comes to rituals that she has to do ‚Äì and the husband just has to fill in the gap with the worldly aspects. Maintaining the shrine. Organizing festivals. Arranging banquets. Managing the finances. Keeping records. Reaching out to the Human Village. Expansion with a couple of buildings to, for starters, isolate the Hakurei honden and separate the living space.\n\nAnd maybe, commune with the Hakurei god and find out what Reimu's doing wrong. And maybe, worship it properly too.","artistId":"suwaneko","characterIds":["reimu"]},"artist":{"id":"suwaneko","name":"„Åô„ÇèÁå´","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/suwaneko10","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/31855616","portrait":"portraits/artists/suwaneko.webp","artworkCount":15,"characterCount":9},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":206,"artistCount":96}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1f0vnlx","img":"https://i.redd.it/9n241ppp4tkd1.png"},{"id":"1faee4q","img":"https://i.redd.it/khliw9t6r6nd1.png"},{"id":"1d7wwk9","img":"https://i.redd.it/gm6kd3032k4d1.png"},{"id":"1bx9doc","img":"https://i.redd.it/b2tr9kiyhusc1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1kzwdhs","nextPostId":"1kzzczm"}}
