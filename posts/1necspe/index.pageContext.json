Wait a minute... is it possible that this is what she looked like when she became a celestial? Like, Chiko/Tenshi stopped growing physically too. That's why she looks like a middle school kid.\n\nI think I can see the spectrum now – Tenshi is just a little taller than Remilia and Flandre.","artistId":"hekaheka","characterIds":["tenshi","iku"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"hekaheka","name":"へかへか","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/hinaheka","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/15430775","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/sniper.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":2},"characters":[{"id":"iku","name":"Nagae Iku","short_name":"Iku","work":["swr"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/iku.webp","artworkCount":4,"artistCount":4},{"id":"tenshi","name":"Hinanawi Tenshi","short_name":"Tenshi","work":["swr"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/tenshi.webp","artworkCount":6,"artistCount":6}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1ne32fm","nextPostId":"1neon26"}}
