Alice's dolls aren't autonomous, so Shanghai is out. Medicine, however, may fit the bill as a Wood Golem or a Wool Golem, depending on what material she was made of.\n\nHmm... but with that reasoning, would every tsukumogami count as a golem as well? I suppose we can limit the definition to \"***being artificially created***\"? So people like Medicine and Kogasa are out because they weren't constructed, but born naturally.\n\nBut where does that put Aunn then? Her case certainly doesn't paint a picture of being constructed. I mean, sure, it's Okina's doing – but it's pretty much the same case as to how the tsukumogami got a power boost with the Miracle Mallet...","artistId":"zannen_na_hito","characterIds":["yoshika","aun","mayumi"]}}}
