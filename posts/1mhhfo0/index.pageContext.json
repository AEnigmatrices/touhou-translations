And it's huge. Like, everybody who's been in school has at the very least heard of it. I guess kinda like *The Great Gatsby*.\n\nOne little detail with this setup is that this novel's author is called ***Murasaki** Shikibu*. That exact same character for ***Yukari***. One assumption we can play around with is that this is Yakumo Yukari, full stop. However, some circumstance drove her to end up looking like Merry.\n\nIf we position this in such a way that Shikibu became a sukima y≈çkai later (1000s), then that definitely makes her younger than Mok≈ç and possibly Aky≈´ (700s). Murasaki Shikibu was possibly a Fujiwara.\n\nWait a minute... Murasaki Shikibu... Murasaki Shiki...
