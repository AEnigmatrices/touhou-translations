Sure, there's the 脱 that means strip, but the whole phrase \"[人肌脱い](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ひと肌脱ぐ)\" (which literally means something like \"take off your skin\") is figurative for lending a helping hand.\n\nNo idea of the context though. Maybe it's like taking off your gloves? 🤔 Taking off your outer layer to help others sincerely?","artistId":"enoki","characterIds":["aya","reimu"]}}}
