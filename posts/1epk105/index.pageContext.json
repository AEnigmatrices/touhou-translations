Sure, there's the 脱 that means strip, but the whole phrase \"[人肌脱い](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ひと肌脱ぐ)\" (which literally means something like \"take off your skin\") is figurative for lending a helping hand.\n\nNo idea of the context though. Maybe it's like taking off your gloves? 🤔 Taking off your outer layer to help others sincerely?","artistId":"enoki","characterIds":["aya","reimu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"enoki","name":"えのき","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/enoki_5689","portrait":"portraits/artists/enoki.webp","artworkCount":6,"characterCount":9},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":259,"artistCount":110},{"id":"aya","name":"Shameimaru Aya","short_name":"Aya","work":["pofv","sa","mof","ds"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/aya.webp","artworkCount":69,"artistCount":34}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1efsky0","img":"https://i.redd.it/szky45w3lnfd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1cjzio9","img":"https://i.redd.it/173elhfboeyc1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1fm4uru","img":"https://i.redd.it/g8retic4f6qd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1chl7hy","img":"https://i.redd.it/i0wamvmx8txc1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1eouulh","nextPostId":"1epmpcn"}}
