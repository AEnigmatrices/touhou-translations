Remember, Jōga (Chang'e) is Chinese, not Shinto. Perhaps we can find gods from various pantheons there, just like how there are various yōkai in the sanctuary that is Gensōkyō. Maybe Hecatia's grandma Phoebe is a Lunarian.\n\nAnd not everybody's there, it seems. Konoha and Ariya are back on Earth. And Ōkuninushi and Takeminakata are sealed in shimenawa?","artistId":"nantara","characterIds":["reisen","eirin","toyohime","yorihime","sagume","kaguya"]},"artist":{"id":"nantara","name":"#なんたら#","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/nantara3080","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/17879222","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/pyro.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":19},"characters":[{"id":"reisen","name":"Reisen Udongein Inaba","short_name":"Reisen","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reisen.webp","artworkCount":58,"artistCount":33},{"id":"eirin","name":"Yagokoro Eirin","short_name":"Eirin","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/eirin.webp","artworkCount":28,"artistCount":16},{"id":"kaguya","name":"Hōraisan Kaguya","short_name":"Kaguya","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kaguya.webp","artworkCount":37,"artistCount":16},{"id":"toyohime","name":"Watasuki no Toyohime","short_name":"Toyohime","work":["ssib","fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/toyohime.webp","artworkCount":14,"artistCount":10},{"id":"yorihime","name":"Watatsuki no Yorihime","short_name":"Yorihime","work":["ssib"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yorihime.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":5},{"id":"sagume","name":"Kishin Sagume","short_name":"Sagume","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sagume.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":6}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1nk2bwr","img":"https://i.redd.it/cuocz9q5rvpf1.png"},{"id":"1b9ol78","img":"https://i.redd.it/l585g5vi94nc1.png"},{"id":"1i1wpwf","img":"https://i.redd.it/j3grmftvm5de1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1nw7smn","nextPostId":"1nwt2qy"}}
