And so, she meditates a lot. Maybe even frequents Byakuren's or Kasen's place for that.\n\nActually... wait a minute. The only source that calls Tojiko an onryō is Akyū in the *Symposium*. Everywhere else, she's a ghost like Yuyuko. So I suppose ZUN's idea is that she's a ghost who used to be vengeful?\n\nAlso... unless Akyū was mistaken, Tojiko's lightning ability is not a Soga family thing too (which on the contrary can certainly be the case). Tojiko's lightning comes from the simple fact that she's an onryō – it's a racial ability. This means **Mizuchi** should be able to use lightning as well.\n\nLightning seems to be equated with anger in Touhou.","artistId":"rowen_taro","characterIds":["tojiko","futo","miko"]},"artist":{"id":"rowen_taro","name":"ローエン太郎","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/roowen_taro","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":3,"characterCount":3},"characters":[{"id":"tojiko","name":"Soga no Tojiko","short_name":"Tojiko","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/tojiko.webp","artworkCount":22,"artistCount":17},{"id":"futo","name":"Mononobe no Futo","short_name":"Futo","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/futo.webp","artworkCount":17,"artistCount":16},{"id":"miko","name":"Toyosatomimi no Miko","short_name":"Miko","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/miko.webp","artworkCount":35,"artistCount":24}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1kd1i5v","img":"https://i.redd.it/k7ttcyt7jdye1.png"},{"id":"1l8urhl","img":"https://i.redd.it/xqu9mhvlab6f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1kjauh8","nextPostId":"1kk0ccz"}}
