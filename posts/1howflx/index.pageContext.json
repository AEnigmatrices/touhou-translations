The design inconsistency for Yuyuko would be her **hair length**.\n\nFrom her original portrait in PCB, it's possible that the hair is shoulder-length. But if we go strictly by what we see, it is neck-length – further clarified by her portrait in TD. The fighting games, on the other hand, assumed the shoulder-length stance. And some canon depictions certainly took that as reference, the most recent example being in FDS.\n\nWhat's your default Yuyuko look?
