DESTROY MY ENEMIES, AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!”\n\nThe sky split apart, and the god of magic stepped through. Descending from Hell, she saw the makings of a god in a mere mortal. Hecatia would save Marisa. She would turn her into the perfect witch. Her servant on Earth. Only a simple pledge of loyalty was required.\n\n**“My life is yours, Hecatia. From this day, I shall carry forth your will.”**\n\nAnd her fate was sealed. As promised, Hecatia rescued her new disciple. Bringing forth the power of a Hellenic god, destroying those who would slaughter Marisa.\n\nNo mere broom and furnace would befit the newest servant of the god of magic. The Staff of Chaos, enchanted in the cloudiest districts of Whiterun. Once attached, the chains remain so, chained and seared to the flesh, a part of the bearer's body, a permanent reminder of Marisa's pledge – in return, ultimate power. The mystery of Hecatia exploded from within.\n\nBut soon, she would learn the true cost of such power. A cost too high even for Marisa to borrow.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["marisa"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"marisa","name":"Kirisame Marisa","short_name":"Marisa","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/marisa.webp","artworkCount":161,"artistCount":75}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1k1c2gf","img":"https://i.redd.it/xjihicu27eve1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1m68aiw","img":"https://i.redd.it/lqoua0givdef1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lryjly","img":"https://i.redd.it/1xoe2l3clyaf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nhfwhz","img":"https://i.redd.it/pacazhuocapf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1lpq59y","nextPostId":"1lqbcqk"}}
