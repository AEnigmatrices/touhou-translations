I mean, sure, it's supposed to be crossroads and relate her to being a chimatagami, but still.\n\nHmm... maybe \"again\" is a way of saying thousand twice? So it's technically \"Chiji\" (千々) which would basically be \"thousands\"","artistId":"zakozako_y","characterIds":["chimata"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"zakozako_y","name":"ザコザコY","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/zakozakoY","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/3027596","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/soldier.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":10},"characters":[{"id":"chimata","name":"Tenkyū Chimata","short_name":"Chimata","work":["um"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/chimata.webp","artworkCount":16,"artistCount":13}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1o9q1mp","img":"https://i.redd.it/klbymhz5vtvf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1h79liq","img":"https://i.redd.it/hr4oviktb15e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1pkmf84","img":"https://i.redd.it/naicd74kcq6g1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1p3wx0g","nextPostId":"1p4hai2"}}
