The gist of the experience is that you go through several trays worth of **small** bowls of soba – and Yuyuko here, well... they're small for her, I suppose. That is to say, I guess that's what Yōmu's saying there.\n\nHell 🤨 at first I thought it's a dog joke, and then maybe she doesn't know what a wanko soba is. You know, wanko is \"doggy\" in Japanese (it means \"small bowl\" in this soba's context.)","artistId":"deetamu","characterIds":["youmu","yuyuko"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"deetamu","name":"で～たむ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/simerike5","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/3079181","portrait":"portraits/artists/deetamu.webp","artworkCount":57,"characterCount":27},"characters":[{"id":"youmu","name":"Konpaku Yōmu","short_name":"Yōmu","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/youmu.webp","artworkCount":43,"artistCount":26},{"id":"yuyuko","name":"Saigyōji Yuyuko","short_name":"Yuyuko","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuyuko.webp","artworkCount":22,"artistCount":17}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1g19018","img":"https://i.redd.it/wo2q6zjui4ud1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ftq7bi","img":"https://i.redd.it/db829z53t5sd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1hzo9w7","img":"https://i.redd.it/27kpoyx9tkce1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1likg7x","img":"https://i.redd.it/9cq5g5tj9p8f1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1nibent","nextPostId":"1niy26y"}}
