The gist of the experience is that you go through several trays worth of **small** bowls of soba – and Yuyuko here, well... they're small for her, I suppose. That is to say, I guess that's what Yōmu's saying there.\n\nHell 🤨 at first I thought it's a dog joke, and then maybe she doesn't know what a wanko soba is.
