This is an OC from Gokuu's Skeb request box. The idea is that she's another of Yukari's shikigami ‚Äì a **seven-tailed** silver fox.\n\nThe character is \"**Ëíº**\" which means blue. Normally we'd read that as \"Ao\", but the request specifies the Chinese pronunciation, which would be Tsan. On the other hand, this raises an interesting implication ‚Äì that the Yakumo shikigami all use Chinese names. Chen is already one such example. Indeed, \"Chen\" is not a Japanese reading for the character.\n\nChen would be **Ch√©ng**. Ran would be **L√°n**. And as for Tsan here? **CƒÅng**. ü§® Actually, I should also explain what these tonal marks mean. So a rising line means a high note, while a straight line means a neutral note ‚Äì it dictates how high/low you're supposed to pronounce them.\n\nAnd yeah, I suppose another familiar way to render the name would be **Tsang**. Same structure as Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat.","artistId":"gokuu","characterIds":["ran"]},"artist":{"id":"gokuu","name":"„Åî„Åè„ÅÜ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/acoloredpencil","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/4006924","portrait":"/portraits/artists/gokuu.webp","artworkCount":7},"characters":[{"id":"ran","name":"Yakumo Ran","short_name":"Ran","work":["pcb","udoalg"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/ran.webp","artworkCount":26}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1izf0a1","img":"https://i.redd.it/10mt0tsrhole1.png"},{"id":"1hgb2wr","img":"https://i.redd.it/o8ah34y4ze7e1.png"},{"id":"1h6gr1b","img":"https://i.redd.it/btzk2hi99u4e1.png"},{"id":"1j07plc","img":"https://i.redd.it/lbeqftgwtvle1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1htergd","nextPostId":"1hu6fev"}}
