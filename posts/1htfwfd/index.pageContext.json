This is an OC from Gokuu's Skeb request box. The idea is that she's another of Yukari's shikigami – a **seven-tailed** silver fox.\n\nThe character is \"**蒼**\" which means blue. Normally we'd read that as \"Ao\", but the request specifies the Chinese pronunciation, which would be Tsan. On the other hand, this raises an interesting implication – that the Yakumo shikigami all use Chinese names. Chen is already one such example. Indeed, \"Chen\" is not a Japanese reading for the character.\n\nChen would be **Chéng**. Ran would be **Lán**. And as for Tsan here? **Cāng**. 🤨 Actually, I should also explain what these tonal marks mean. So a rising line means a high note, while a straight line means a neutral note – it dictates how high/low you're supposed to pronounce them.\n\nAnd yeah, I suppose another familiar way to render the name would be **Tsang**. Same structure as Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat.","artistId":"gokuu","characterIds":["ran"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"gokuu","name":"ごくう","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/acoloredpencil","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/4006924","portrait":"portraits/artists/gokuu.webp","artworkCount":8,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"ran","name":"Yakumo Ran","short_name":"Ran","work":["pcb","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ran.webp","artworkCount":40,"artistCount":26}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mntiue","img":"https://i.redd.it/qc162l3wbhif1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jjilmf","img":"https://i.redd.it/07asszzj1uqe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1hgb2wr","img":"https://i.redd.it/o8ah34y4ze7e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1izf0a1","img":"https://i.redd.it/10mt0tsrhole1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1htergd","nextPostId":"1hu6fev"}}
