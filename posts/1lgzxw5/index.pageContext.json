Sarutahiko – the patron god of the tengu [**according to Aya**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Symposium_of_Post-mysticism/Bunbunmaru_Newspaper_4) – is also conflated with Dōsojin. Though in this context it's most likely \"the\" Dōsojin and not \"a\" Dōsojin, so quite unlikely for Nareko to be Sarutahiko (and have Ame-no-Uzume as her wife).
