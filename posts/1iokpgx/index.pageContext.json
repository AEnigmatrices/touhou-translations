In fact, Yūka does encounter Sakuya in [**her route**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story/Yuuka%27s_Scenario#Yuuka_vs_Sakuya_(Episode_3,_4_or_5)), and she compares flowers with human transience.

For the banters, when Sakuya defeats Yūka, she'll ask for [**sunflower seeds**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story/Sakuya%27s_Script#Sakuya_defeats_Yuuka) to make sunflower oil.\n\nWhen Yūka defeats Sakuya, though, Sakuya gets compared with the [**fourwing evening primrose**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Story/Yuuka%27s_Script#Yuuka_defeats_Sakuya).
