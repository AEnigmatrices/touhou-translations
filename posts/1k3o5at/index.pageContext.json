Actually, you think Satori is also really good at telling what people are thinking without actually using her mind reading ability? 🤔\n\nLogically, we'd assume she's bad at conventionally reading people to counterbalance the mind reading ability. But imagine yourself in her shoes. Now stop smelling them for a moment and think just how boring mind-reading would be at some point. You can immediately tell what the person is thinking. Out of boredom, you start looking at their body language, what exactly they're saying, how exactly they're saying – and try to read them without your ability.\n\nBefore you know it, you've actually become pretty good at finding clues and forming deductions.","artistId":"diz","characterIds":["satori"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"diz","name":"DiZ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/dizsonyasuna","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/7499778","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":1},"characters":[{"id":"satori","name":"Komeiji Satori","short_name":"Satori","work":["sa"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/satori.webp","artworkCount":45,"artistCount":30}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1k3n4zg","nextPostId":"1k4csdc"}}
