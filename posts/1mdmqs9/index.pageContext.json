As a lot of us may already be aware of, if we go by the hat color, Hatate's \"rank\" is actually really high – higher than Megumu even. But still professionally, she's possibly much less experienced than even Momiji.\n\nOn the other hand, while Momiji sports a red cap which puts her on the same rank as Aya, her position is actually rank-and-file.
