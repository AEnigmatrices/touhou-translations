Sagume the trickster god.\n\nHmm... I suppose while Sagume can't turn her ability off, she still at least knows which words will cause changes? 🤨 Wait, she can talk just fine with those four though, right? But she's also careful with her word choices. So I guess that translates in practice to a person who just doesn't talk much? What a tricky character to depict.\n\nOh wait – it's supposed to be \"Sengen-sama\" there.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["sagume","yuiman"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":26,"characterCount":17},"characters":[{"id":"sagume","name":"Kishin Sagume","short_name":"Sagume","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sagume.webp","artworkCount":11,"artistCount":6},{"id":"yuiman","name":"Yuiman Asama","short_name":"Yuiman","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuiman.webp","artworkCount":19,"artistCount":12}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lo1u0p","img":"https://i.redd.it/ldc2m3b8u0af1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o3zbd9","img":"https://i.redd.it/2tw9771u9iuf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lv4iin","img":"https://i.redd.it/yhi8bptgpqbf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mapyko","img":"https://i.redd.it/pc2evamiwfff1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1oerv2o","nextPostId":"1ofetex"}}
