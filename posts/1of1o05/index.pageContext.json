Sagume the trickster god.\n\nHmm... I suppose while Sagume can't turn her ability off, she still at least knows which words will cause changes? 🤨 Wait, she can talk just fine with those four though, right? But she's also careful with her word choices. So I guess that translates in practice to a person who just doesn't talk much? What a tricky character to depict.\n\nOh wait – it's supposed to be \"Sengen-sama\" there.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["sagume","yuiman"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"sagume","name":"Kishin Sagume","short_name":"Sagume","work":["lolk"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sagume.webp","artworkCount":13,"artistCount":8},{"id":"yuiman","name":"Yuiman Asama","short_name":"Yuiman","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuiman.webp","artworkCount":24,"artistCount":15}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lpzodg","img":"https://i.redd.it/kxge1exqhhaf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jh5zf5","img":"https://i.redd.it/lbvcna3h38qe1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jrdrty","img":"https://i.redd.it/ctdzel630use1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1om482p","img":"https://i.redd.it/q6z1glwmsqyf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1oerv2o","nextPostId":"1ofetex"}}
