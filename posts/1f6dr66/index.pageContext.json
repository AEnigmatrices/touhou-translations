The fairy maids will probably start wearing much more fancy uniforms too.\n\nMeanwhile, if Alice herself isn't enjoying cups of tea with Patchouli... actually, she'd probably just hang around the library alongside Patchouli – occasionally holding a research session together, but still mostly focused on her own magic stuff.","artistId":"chakomaru","characterIds":["alice","sakuya"]},"artist":{"id":"chakomaru","name":"ちゃこまる","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/_chapo_o","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/heavy.webp","artworkCount":2,"characterCount":4},"characters":[{"id":"sakuya","name":"Izayoi Sakuya","short_name":"Sakuya","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sakuya.webp","artworkCount":60,"artistCount":37},{"id":"alice","name":"Alice Margatroid","short_name":"Alice","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/alice.webp","artworkCount":25,"artistCount":19}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1kmfqlc","img":"https://i.redd.it/re9e79d66r0f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1f5p5sz","nextPostId":"1f6gf4o"}}
