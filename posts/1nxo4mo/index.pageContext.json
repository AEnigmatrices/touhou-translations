Now, why would Ariya be sad from sensing Kanako? Is it really just nostalgia?\n\nIf we go by the omake, we can make this conjecture. Ariya abandoned Yuiman to the Lunarians. Just because she's stubborn on rejecting all changes. Before setting off the incident, Eirin definitely briefed Kanako about the pyramid. She definitely already knew from the start that Yuiman's in there.\n\nAnd we can accommodate the scenario further by assuming that even though the Lunarians took over Ariya and Yuiman's shrine, the location itself remains Ariya's shrine. This means the following may be the case – the Lunarian engineers didn't implement something as basic as throttling the data input for Yuiman simply because they couldn't. The shrine inherently rejects change. They were already pushing the limits just setting Yuiman up for purification duties and the pipeline to the Lunar Capital.\n\nIn this interpretation, we can say that Ariya has some responsibility over this incident.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["marisa","ariya","kanako"]},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":24,"characterCount":16},"characters":[{"id":"marisa","name":"Kirisame Marisa","short_name":"Marisa","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/marisa.webp","artworkCount":139,"artistCount":66},{"id":"kanako","name":"Yasaka Kanako","short_name":"Kanako","work":["mof"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kanako.webp","artworkCount":12,"artistCount":9},{"id":"ariya","name":"Iwanaga Ariya","short_name":"Ariya","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ariya.webp","artworkCount":17,"artistCount":10}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1kuawqw","img":"https://i.redd.it/uauffr6m8q2f1.png"},{"id":"1lo1u0p","img":"https://i.redd.it/ldc2m3b8u0af1.png"},{"id":"1o5nv2o","img":"https://i.redd.it/9mso9kh8kwuf1.png"},{"id":"1jjl5rl","img":"https://i.redd.it/tckjlxctmuqe1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1nxgs38","nextPostId":"1nxxtck"}}
