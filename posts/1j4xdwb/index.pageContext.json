On the other hand, it'd be pretty interesting if she's very acquainted with herbology, which would put her on the same wavelength as Eirin.\n\nAnd as for Reisen... is there even anything to forage up there? Does the Lunar Capital have a wild, untamed area in the first place? Actually, where exactly on the moon did the girls land at back in Silent Sinner in Blue? Is it really a shoreline by some forest? Or is it more of a garden? A corner of a public park? Like, shit. What if they were actually in the middle of the equivalent of Central Park?","artistId":"sniper","characterIds":["tewi","reisen"]}}}
