While there were yōkai who must be saved from extermination, there were also yōkai who kept painting a bigger target on their backs. Byakuren also had to conventionally protect humans, after all. They definitely killed a lot of yōkai who didn't fall in line and kept attacking humans.","artistId":"nekobatake","characterIds":["shou"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"nekobatake","name":"ネコバタケ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/catfiield","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/561777","portrait":"portraits/artists/nekobatake.webp","artworkCount":9,"characterCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"shou","name":"Toramaru Shō","short_name":"Shō","work":["ufo"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/shou.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":8}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1bfcxrv","img":"https://i.redd.it/gvmg828zshoc1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mgmwnh","img":"https://i.redd.it/4zt6npmvutgf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lloblz","img":"https://i.redd.it/klwisoltff9f1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1kekduz","img":"https://i.redd.it/ghrqxobltrye1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1mypr8y","nextPostId":"1mzc4bh"}}
