I dunno. Like, it's definitely one of the things I use to identify her. And thematically, I see it as the slug that represents herself in the Slug-Frog-Snake trio. Though I suppose one can also argue that she doesn't need it anyway since she herself is already here. 🤔\n\nOh, and do note that everybody else is still drawing her wearing it lmao.\n\nSanae's portraits are, from left-to-right, from [**Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Th15Sanae.png), [**Unconnected Marketeers**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Th18Sanae.png), and [**Unfinished Dream of All Living Ghost**](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/File:Th19Sanae.png).\n\nOn the snake part, the original says it goes counterclockwise... but there's no way it's going counterclockwise here?\n\nI guess... it does if we start from the head to the tail, but that feels reallyyy counterintuitive. Or is it normal to describe a coil from bottom-to-top?\n\n>🤨 Am I drunk?","artistId":"itatatata","characterIds":["sanae"]},"artist":{"id":"itatatata","name":"いたたたた","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/itatatata6","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/29434482","portrait":"portraits/artists/itatatata.webp","artworkCount":6,"characterCount":15},"characters":[{"id":"sanae","name":"Kochiya Sanae","short_name":"Sanae","work":["mof","sa","ufo","soku","td","lolk","um","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sanae.webp","artworkCount":49,"artistCount":34}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1hqgla8","img":"https://i.redd.it/yb2icz4p97ae1.png"},{"id":"1j1sbtt","img":"https://i.redd.it/xhu5senbgame1.png"},{"id":"1gqc6iq","img":"https://i.redd.it/9z4mdfig1o0e1.png"},{"id":"1g46wkb","img":"https://i.redd.it/aejf701f2xud1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1hvt1rj","nextPostId":"1hwl8h9"}}
