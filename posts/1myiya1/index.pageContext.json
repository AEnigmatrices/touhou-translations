Ah! Once it seems, in her omake, but followed by Seiga recently recommending stretches.\n\nNote that the first panel is \"勅令 随身保命\" which would mean something like \"Imperial Decree: Follow and Protect\". This is a popular phrase to draw on Yoshika's seal, as it's used in a famous Jiang Shi movie. That is to say, unrelated to the comic itself and in practice part of Yoshika's design.","artistId":"signal_mass","characterIds":["seiga","yoshika"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"signal_mass","name":"坂本しぐま","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/SignalMass","portrait":"portraits/artists/signal_mass.webp","artworkCount":21,"characterCount":41},"characters":[{"id":"yoshika","name":"Miyako Yoshika","short_name":"Yoshika","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yoshika.webp","artworkCount":18,"artistCount":15},{"id":"seiga","name":"Kaku Seiga","short_name":"Seiga","work":["td"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/seiga.webp","artworkCount":20,"artistCount":16}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1i46wt7","img":"https://i.redd.it/a92ou53j1rde1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1igobb5","img":"https://i.redd.it/ufuyqc8n7xge1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1i3gsjh","img":"https://i.redd.it/6r4a4wn77kde1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1htergd","img":"https://i.redd.it/0u9kequ6fzae1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1my5a77","nextPostId":"1mypr8y"}}
