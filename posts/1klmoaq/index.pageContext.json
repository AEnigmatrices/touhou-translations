A dog running across the sky as a **shooting star**... Huh. And eclipses were attributed to the tiangou swallowing the moon.\n\nThere's a version of the Chang'e legend where the tiangou was Houyi's hunting dog... after Chang'e took the elixir and fled, the dog licked up the remaining elixir on the floor, chased after Chang'e and swallowed her along with the moon she's hiding on (later spitting them out after getting a reward). The tiangou then eventually became Erlang Shen's dog ‚Äì [**Xi√†otiƒÅn Qu«én**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaotian_Quan).\n\nSo we have here a y≈çkai shooting star dog who took the H≈çrai Elixir, was instrumental in concluding the Chang'e affair on the side of the Lunarians, and was the hunting dog of the famous three-eyed Chinese warrior god who is an equal to the legendary to Sun Wukong?\n\nHuh, now that's a decent ground to ship Satori with Aya/Momiji/Hatate/Megumu. There's no perfect match though. It has to be a **black dog**... You know what. Just check out Black Myth. Yes, I'm saying Tenma is that dog.","artistId":"miragu","characterIds":["aya","megumu","satori"]},"artist":{"id":"miragu","name":"„Åø„Çâ„Åê","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/mirag32","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/195511","portrait":"/portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"aya","name":"Shameimaru Aya","short_name":"Aya","work":["pofv","sa","mof","ds"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/aya.webp","artworkCount":51,"artistCount":26},{"id":"satori","name":"Komeiji Satori","short_name":"Satori","work":["sa"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/satori.webp","artworkCount":33,"artistCount":25},{"id":"megumu","name":"Iizunamaru Megumu","short_name":"Megumu","work":["um"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/megumu.webp","artworkCount":14,"artistCount":10}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1jfpatc","img":"https://i.redd.it/xzdmrct1nupe1.png"},{"id":"1jxd6dw","img":"https://i.redd.it/dfot2qu1edue1.png"},{"id":"1kov9pb","img":"https://i.redd.it/xi8qfyxxyc1f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1kll58g","nextPostId":"1klny6y"}}
