With how lazy Reimu is, I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't even know these techniques exist. She wouldn't need to. The current Gensōkyō doesn't need them.\n\n**Mizuchi** would know, though... is this the real reason why she's so dangerous? She can give yōkai a really, really bad time.","artistId":"suwaneko","characterIds":["reimu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"suwaneko","name":"すわ猫","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/suwaneko10","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/31855616","portrait":"portraits/artists/suwaneko.webp","artworkCount":19,"characterCount":11},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":257,"artistCount":110}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1d7wwk9","img":"https://i.redd.it/gm6kd3032k4d1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1p1bio3","img":"https://i.redd.it/rn07f9w8l82g1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1oiyl1v","img":"https://i.redd.it/5678kc5ec0yf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1ou3sjq","img":"https://i.redd.it/0q5a31ex4l0g1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1j7735p","nextPostId":"1j796no"}}
