With how lazy Reimu is, I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't even know these techniques exist. She wouldn't need to. The current Gensōkyō doesn't need them.\n\n**Mizuchi** would know, though... is this the real reason why she's so dangerous? She can give yōkai a really, really bad time.","artistId":"suwaneko","characterIds":["reimu"]},"artist":{"id":"suwaneko","name":"すわ猫","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/suwaneko10","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/31855616","portrait":"portraits/artists/suwaneko.webp","artworkCount":15,"characterCount":9},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":206,"artistCount":96}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1g51ia6","img":"https://i.redd.it/c6nxfa89v4vd1.png"},{"id":"1bx9doc","img":"https://i.redd.it/b2tr9kiyhusc1.png"},{"id":"1hmoo1n","img":"https://i.redd.it/w1wu9db9679e1.png"},{"id":"1iokpgx","img":"https://i.redd.it/h5sze72b6xie1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1j7735p","nextPostId":"1j796no"}}
