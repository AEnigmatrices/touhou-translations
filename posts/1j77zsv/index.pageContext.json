With how lazy Reimu is, I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't even know these techniques exist. She wouldn't need to. The current Gensōkyō doesn't need them.\n\n**Mizuchi** would know, though... is this the real reason why she's so dangerous? She can give yōkai a really, really bad time.","artistId":"suwaneko","characterIds":["reimu"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"suwaneko","name":"すわ猫","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/suwaneko10","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/31855616","portrait":"portraits/artists/suwaneko.webp","artworkCount":19,"characterCount":11},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":268,"artistCount":115}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1hlf4vi","img":"https://i.redd.it/49f5xeam8t8e1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1gmizwd","img":"https://i.redd.it/0g1re6vgnozd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1faee4q","img":"https://i.redd.it/khliw9t6r6nd1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jw04td","img":"https://i.redd.it/zlnlihq0w0ue1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1j7735p","nextPostId":"1j796no"}}
