Well, Orin's tips are on fire, so that's probably the one-step-above Chen – or that just comes with being a kasha. Ngl, I find the idea of Chen(!) being able to go toe-to-toe with Orin to be very interesting.\n\nIf I were to speculate, I'd say Chen's power has actually been limited, while the shikigami itself grows accustomed to the bakeneko it's possessing. As the compatibility increases, more power is unlocked. But now? She's at the \"Gotta stay away from water\" kind of weak. But if the shikigami's out of the equation, that bakeneko is a Stage 5 boss material.","artistId":"ratenbo","characterIds":["reimu","chen","orin","mike"]},"artist":{"id":"ratenbo","name":"ラテンボ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/ratenbo","portrait":"/portraits/placeholders/medic.webp","artworkCount":1,"characterCount":4},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":162,"artistCount":77},{"id":"chen","name":"Chen","short_name":"Chen","work":["pcb"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/chen.webp","artworkCount":22,"artistCount":14},{"id":"orin","name":"Kaenbyō Rin","short_name":"Orin","work":["sa","udoalg"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/orin.webp","artworkCount":23,"artistCount":17},{"id":"mike","name":"Gōtokuji Mike","short_name":"Mike","work":["um"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/mike.webp","artworkCount":5,"artistCount":5}],"randomArtistPosts":[],"prevPostId":"1ax5fzj","nextPostId":"1azn05s"}}
