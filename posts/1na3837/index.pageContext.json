And I do hate those stairs that blur the boundaries between a staircase and a ladder.\n\nAnd the idea of Banki being a waitress (or cook?) in the village is certainly interesting. Something ZUN can (and by that, I mean probably won't) do is revealing Banki being a part-timer at Geidontei. That she works the day shift, so the y≈çkai regulars would have no idea about her, and she's so good at hiding it that Miyoi couldn't tell in the first place that she's a rokurokubi.\n\nThinking about the makeup trend, I think it's the pretty likely that it's \"whatever washed up and got distributed to the village\". Might be some lost boxes of foundations and lipsticks that sell like hot cakes in the village whenever they come up. Maybe Yukari sets the trend by gapping specific items in.\n\nWhile it's funny and cute to think that Hime subsists on sea grass, if we assume that she really is a smelt, then she should be carnivorous üêü Anyway, I guess in this case it's safe to assume that she doesn't know about utensils either. Forget chopsticks, she probably thinks a fork is a hair brush.\n\nAnd more importantly, given that she is a fish, Hime definitely has a slimy skin. üóø No, don't you f#cking dare grab the food with your hands. We'll feed you, or at least tell us which ones you want on your plate.","artistId":"koyane","characterIds":["wakasagihime","sekibanki","kagerou"]},"artist":{"id":"koyane","name":"ÂÖêÂ±ã","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Silver81106","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1225841","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":8},"characters":[{"id":"wakasagihime","name":"Wakasagihime","short_name":"Wakasagihime","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/wakasagihime.webp","artworkCount":8,"artistCount":7},{"id":"sekibanki","name":"Sekibanki","short_name":"Sekibanki","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sekibanki.webp","artworkCount":12,"artistCount":10},{"id":"kagerou","name":"Imaizumi Kager≈ç","short_name":"Kager≈ç","work":["ddc"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kagerou.webp","artworkCount":10,"artistCount":8}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1mn71kx","img":"https://i.redd.it/ffug75ulkcif1.png"},{"id":"1mypr8y","img":"https://i.redd.it/lsl8fadfcxkf1.png"},{"id":"1mtfu9x","img":"https://i.redd.it/9xuzr8mxiqjf1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1n9txqj","nextPostId":"1nagioi"}}
