I suppose it wouldn't be too far a leap to assume that this is not the only event she hosts. Preparing banquets might just be what she considers her job. Tewi might even be the one encouraging it. There are many deals to cut and much information to glean in the background of events like these. \n\nWhile the shut-in princess Kaguya is a popular image, she is actually rather outgoing. For one, she does go out to kill (and/or be killed by) Mokō. And Akyū even notes that she's really good at holding conversations. Just imagine her frequenting Kōmakan and Hakugyokurō for cups of tea with their mistresses.","artistId":"tofuya","characterIds":["kaguya"]},"artist":{"id":"tofuya","name":"と〜ふや","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/Otofu_seller","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/23151908","portrait":"portraits/artists/tofuya.webp","artworkCount":30,"characterCount":29},"characters":[{"id":"kaguya","name":"Hōraisan Kaguya","short_name":"Kaguya","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/kaguya.webp","artworkCount":37,"artistCount":16}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1jacctu","img":"https://i.redd.it/tt65aasnogoe1.png"},{"id":"1juftsv","img":"https://i.redd.it/fhy4ytgimmte1.png"},{"id":"1kzwdhs","img":"https://i.redd.it/j801fdos644f1.png"},{"id":"1kz3jwj","img":"https://i.redd.it/nzsw6a8w2x3f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1moyibn","nextPostId":"1mpl2p8"}}
