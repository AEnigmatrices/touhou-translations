The sentence can be divided like this:\n\n- 上は大火事\n- 下は大洪水\n- 間はジャングルのへんなやつ\n- ってだれ?\n\nWhich would be: \"Above Fire + Below Flood + Between Strange Jungle Thing = Who?\" However, if we time it differently as so:\n\n- 上は大火事\n- 下は大洪水\n- 間はジャングル\n- のへんなやつってだれ?\n\nThen it becomes: \"Above Fire + Below Flood + Between Jungle = Who This Strange Thing?\"\n\nOh, and this is a Japanese classic riddle. The answer is a bathtub. The hot thing above is the steam. The flood is the water. And this strange creature from the jungle is, well, a human. I think normally it has only the Fire and Flood parts though.\n\nAnd the older (and I think also the more well-known) rendition switches the Fire and Flood positions (when you heat your bathtub with actual fire being below.)","artistId":"nakache","characterIds":["nareko","chimi"]},"artist":{"id":"nakache","name":"なかちぇ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/na_ka_che","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/engineer.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":7},"characters":[{"id":"chimi","name":"Hōjū Chimi","short_name":"Chimi","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/chimi.webp","artworkCount":7,"artistCount":7},{"id":"nareko","name":"Michigami Nareko","short_name":"Nareko","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/nareko.webp","artworkCount":15,"artistCount":14}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1ecnca1","img":"https://i.redd.it/o84qzh081ved1.png"},{"id":"1ls4thl","img":"https://i.redd.it/8u0f8413k0bf1.png"},{"id":"1dbszr4","img":"https://i.redd.it/me9qbqfulj5d1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1ldr2sq","nextPostId":"1lebtn1"}}
