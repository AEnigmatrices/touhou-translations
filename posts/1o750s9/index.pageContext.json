I do forget from time to time that while she has the medicine theme in Touhou, Omoikane is a wisdom kami. Like, Eirin is not a god of medicine.\n\nI think it'd be interesting to imagine that Eirin does interact with the more intellectually-inclined denizens of Gensōkyō and beyond. Maybe when the witches gather to figure out something esoteric, she does participate to see what these morons will come up with, and give out hints when the research is clearly off the rails. Much more interesting than some genius who does nothing by herself.\n\nHell, maybe she still writes to her inter-pantheon friends like Hecatia's cousin Athena.","artistId":"mendou15","characterIds":["reisen","eirin"]},"artist":{"id":"mendou15","name":"めんどう１５","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/mendo_15___","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/83944581","portrait":"portraits/artists/mendou15.webp","artworkCount":21,"characterCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"reisen","name":"Reisen Udongein Inaba","short_name":"Reisen","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reisen.webp","artworkCount":58,"artistCount":33},{"id":"eirin","name":"Yagokoro Eirin","short_name":"Eirin","work":["in"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/eirin.webp","artworkCount":28,"artistCount":16}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1h8ryen","img":"https://i.redd.it/6lo91tbdcf5e1.png"},{"id":"1gvrlwo","img":"https://i.redd.it/haf7kfa4o22e1.png"},{"id":"1o809l5","img":"https://i.redd.it/lwfz7rmnkfvf1.png"},{"id":"1ea70jh","img":"https://i.redd.it/o6p3if6zl9ed1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1o6w2zt","nextPostId":"1o7f176"}}
