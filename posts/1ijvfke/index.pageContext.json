While it does sound distinct from the very general \"donation\", and fits the religious context, the word itself is specifically Christian.\n\nü§î Or is the offering box also referred to as \"Saisen Bako\" in Japanese? In which case, I suppose \"offering box\" would be appropriate.","artistId":"kyuukei_usagi","characterIds":["reimu","sanae"]},"artist":{"id":"kyuukei_usagi","name":"‰ºëÊÜ©„ÅÜ„Åï„Åé","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/QK_rabbit_2","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/15423708","portrait":"/portraits/placeholders/demoman.webp","artworkCount":6},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":146},{"id":"sanae","name":"Kochiya Sanae","short_name":"Sanae","work":["mof","sa","ufo","soku","td","lolk","um","udoalg"],"portrait":"/portraits/characters/sanae.webp","artworkCount":45}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1fah2md","img":"https://i.redd.it/vud4nq1ic7nd1.png"},{"id":"1f0y383","img":"https://i.redd.it/gpq87gajptkd1.png"},{"id":"1ief6br","img":"https://i.redd.it/fjgu11ij3cge1.png"},{"id":"1jkdg1z","img":"https://i.redd.it/wudw4v6nq1re1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1iju9sk","nextPostId":"1ijwxee"}}
