While it does sound distinct from the very general \"donation\", and fits the religious context, the word itself is specifically Christian.\n\n🤔 Or is the offering box also referred to as \"Saisen Bako\" in Japanese? In which case, I suppose \"offering box\" would be appropriate.","artistId":"kyuukei_usagi","characterIds":["reimu","sanae"]}}}
