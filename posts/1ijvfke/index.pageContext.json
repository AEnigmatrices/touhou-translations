While it does sound distinct from the very general \"donation\", and fits the religious context, the word itself is specifically Christian.\n\n🤔 Or is the offering box also referred to as \"Saisen Bako\" in Japanese? In which case, I suppose \"offering box\" would be appropriate.","artistId":"kyuukei_usagi","characterIds":["reimu","sanae"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"kyuukei_usagi","name":"休憩うさぎ","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/QK_rabbit_2","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/15423708","portrait":"portraits/artists/kyuukei_usagi.webp","artworkCount":11,"characterCount":21},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":254,"artistCount":110},{"id":"sanae","name":"Kochiya Sanae","short_name":"Sanae","work":["mof","sa","ufo","soku","td","lolk","um","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/sanae.webp","artworkCount":63,"artistCount":39}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1i47wuc","img":"https://i.redd.it/r4e9wm4rbrde1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1jkdg1z","img":"https://i.redd.it/wudw4v6nq1re1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1mbwmup","img":"https://i.redd.it/7gf47s0bfpff1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nrh1y5","img":"https://i.redd.it/sv93hllsmlrf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1iju9sk","nextPostId":"1ijwxee"}}
