'Cause È≥• is bird, but crow/raven would be ÁÉè. Yes, it's a difference of one horizontal line. ü§î Or maybe \"crow\" is a misunderstanding in-universe, and there are other bird types in there too? Can you imagine, a **seagull tengu?**\n\nKamidana is basically a home shrine, and... huh, some Christians have it too.\n\nSide door is kinda weird. The original word is \"Kitchen Door\", and the definition itself hinges more on the fact that it's a secondary door for utility instead of the main entrance, and it isn't necessarily always located at the back of the house (hence, it's not always a \"back door\").\n\nBefore the iconic sliding doors, there were the shitomi. Yeah, they're shutters, but they also count as doors if you can remove the bottom panel. And it's a Heian period thing... so Byakuren's time.\n\n\"Ventilation\" also doubles as \"communication\" within an organization.
