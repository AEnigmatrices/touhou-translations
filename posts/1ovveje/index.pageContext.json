And so in all likelihood, ZUN probably got the image of the bird while reading through his kids' homework or something.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["cirno","yuiman","ariya"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"cirno","name":"Cirno","short_name":"Cirno","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/cirno.webp","artworkCount":29,"artistCount":22},{"id":"yuiman","name":"Yuiman Asama","short_name":"Yuiman","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuiman.webp","artworkCount":25,"artistCount":15},{"id":"ariya","name":"Iwanaga Ariya","short_name":"Ariya","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ariya.webp","artworkCount":28,"artistCount":14}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1ngv0u8","img":"https://i.redd.it/468jiwj3l5pf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lpzodg","img":"https://i.redd.it/kxge1exqhhaf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o3zbd9","img":"https://i.redd.it/2tw9771u9iuf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nxo4mo","img":"https://i.redd.it/gxzhksdyx1tf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1ovm0iu","nextPostId":"1ow4vib"}}
