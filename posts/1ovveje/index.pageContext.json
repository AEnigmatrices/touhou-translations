And so in all likelihood, ZUN probably got the image of the bird while reading through his kids' homework or something.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["cirno","yuiman","ariya"],"nsfw":false},"artist":{"id":"yatagarasu","name":"八咫ガラス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/yatagarasu150","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/16223891","portrait":"portraits/artists/yatagarasu.webp","artworkCount":29,"characterCount":18},"characters":[{"id":"cirno","name":"Cirno","short_name":"Cirno","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/cirno.webp","artworkCount":29,"artistCount":22},{"id":"yuiman","name":"Yuiman Asama","short_name":"Yuiman","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/yuiman.webp","artworkCount":25,"artistCount":15},{"id":"ariya","name":"Iwanaga Ariya","short_name":"Ariya","work":["fw"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/ariya.webp","artworkCount":27,"artistCount":14}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1lo1u0p","img":"https://i.redd.it/ldc2m3b8u0af1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1nm2bjg","img":"https://i.redd.it/jcu46rg0hcqf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1lpzodg","img":"https://i.redd.it/kxge1exqhhaf1.png","nsfw":false},{"id":"1o5nv2o","img":"https://i.redd.it/9mso9kh8kwuf1.png","nsfw":false}],"prevPostId":"1ovm0iu","nextPostId":"1ow4vib"}}
