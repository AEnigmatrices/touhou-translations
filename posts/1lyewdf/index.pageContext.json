Flying it is essentially saying you're fighting the enemies of the Imperial Court. The standard image would be the gold sun flag over a red background, though it technically is a set, not just one. The other flag of the pair is the silver moon flag. It is also a word for referring your just cause. Nishiki is silk, by the way.\n\nThe sun representation is obvious since that's the Imperial family with Amaterasu, but I have no f#cking clue what the Tsukuyomi counterpart stands for beyond being a natural cosmic pair as the moon.","artistId":"hikarabita","characterIds":["reimu","mizuchi"]},"artist":{"id":"hikarabita","name":"干からびた大草原","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/o8qZ6riQpwyFtv2","portrait":"portraits/placeholders/soldier.webp","artworkCount":4,"characterCount":5},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":242,"artistCount":104},{"id":"mizuchi","name":"Miyadeguchi Mizuchi","short_name":"Mizuchi","work":["fds"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/mizuchi.webp","artworkCount":24,"artistCount":8}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1hvqqsc","img":"https://i.redd.it/c74k8vegjkbe1.png"},{"id":"1o2m091","img":"https://i.redd.it/dlw520tsd6uf1.png"},{"id":"1ne32fm","img":"https://i.redd.it/baheivcauhof1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1ly3yw9","nextPostId":"1lynfcr"}}
