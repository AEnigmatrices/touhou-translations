But in strictly canon material, as far as my impression goes, she seems more... straightforward? What's she like in UDoALG?\n\nAnd holy shit, Orin's big here. While she's not that big back in the manga panels, it makes me wonder of the possibilities. Like, shit, have we ever seen Chen in her cat form? I mean, imagine if she's actually a lynx! Let's see, in Japanese that's called... big wildcat – \"О̄ Yamaneko\" (大山猫).\n\nReference – [**Chapter 44, Part 2**](https://mangadex.org/chapter/3eec1ec6-4b05-4f05-ad1d-7a86686435b1/12) of Lotus Eaters.","artistId":"k-osu","characterIds":["aya","reimu","orin"]},"artist":{"id":"k-osu","name":"Kオス","linkTwitter":"https://x.com/konton_hakusai","linkPixiv":"https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/18058067","portrait":"portraits/artists/k-osu.webp","artworkCount":5,"characterCount":4},"characters":[{"id":"reimu","name":"Hakurei Reimu","short_name":"Reimu","work":["eosd"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/reimu.webp","artworkCount":200,"artistCount":93},{"id":"aya","name":"Shameimaru Aya","short_name":"Aya","work":["pofv","sa","mof","ds"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/aya.webp","artworkCount":57,"artistCount":28},{"id":"orin","name":"Kaenbyō Rin","short_name":"Orin","work":["sa","udoalg"],"portrait":"portraits/characters/orin.webp","artworkCount":27,"artistCount":19}],"randomArtistPosts":[{"id":"1ld8uy0","img":"https://i.redd.it/wxxjfmryod7f1.png"},{"id":"1li2hwi","img":"https://i.redd.it/uwcpop4bik8f1.png"},{"id":"1hes3ki","img":"https://i.redd.it/52ybdpxzf07e1.png"},{"id":"1kyda3m","img":"https://i.redd.it/pq7ow9etlq3f1.png"}],"prevPostId":"1ge458t","nextPostId":"1gewuac"}}
