Girl will probably make herself Eirin's apprentice, for starters. Eientei's medicine cabinet would probably be locked down and put on guard, so that mad scientist wouldn't be able to perform some truly catastrophic experiments.\n\nAnd assuming the lack of blurring in the language barrier, Maomao will only know Chinese, and at best it'll take her quite a while the figure out Japanese. And on the other hand, I don't think our local Touhou characters knowing kanji characters would translate smoothly to knowing Chinese.\n\nThis also brings up the question about the Lunarians. Since there is Chang'e, I think they speak Chinese up there too ‚Äì so in this case, Reisen, Eirin, and even Kaguya can probably communicate with Maomao. Meiling might be a good interpreter when she travels around Gensokyo. And then there's Seiga... whose alchemy will be definitely catch her interest. Might even move out to live at Shinreibyou instead, even. That palatial place has more of her element anyway.\n\nA better question would be ‚Äì aside from Meiling and Seiga ‚Äì who else would know Chinese? The whole Shinreibyou crew, I think. Yoshika is Seiga's familiar, not to mention being an outright Chinese youkai. And those three probably studied Taoist texts from Seiga's books and scrolls, which would likely be in Chinese. The Myourenji crew might as well, I think ‚Äì 'cause Buddhist texts were also imported from China. The final candidates based on literature would be Akyuu and Keine. Patchouli's too young for that context ‚Äì however, her magic does use Chinese elements...\n\nAnd back to Yoshika, I think we will also get a few more people if we base this on whether the youkai origin is Chinese. Yoshika is a jiangshi... Yachie is a jidiao... Yuuma is a taotie... And Son Biten if she does manage to mantle Sun Wukong...

There was no food, and the others began eating the flesh of those who had died in order to survive. The man, however, stubbornly refused to eat human flesh. One of his friends, unable to watch him die, lied and told him, \"This is sea turtle soup,\" tricking him into eating human flesh and surviving until they were all rescued.

Hecatia would save Marisa. She would turn her into the perfect witch. Her servant on Earth. Only a simple pledge of loyalty was required.\n\n**‚ÄúMy life is yours, Hecatia. From this day, I shall carry forth your will.‚Äù**\n\nAnd her fate was sealed. As promised, Hecatia rescued her new disciple. Bringing forth the power of a Hellenic god, destroying those who would slaughter Marisa.\n\nNo mere broom and furnace would befit the newest servant of the god of magic. The Staff of Chaos, enchanted in the cloudiest districts of Whiterun. Once attached, the chains remain so, chained and seared to the flesh, a part of the bearer's body, a permanent reminder of Marisa's pledge ‚Äì in return, ultimate power. The mystery of Hecatia exploded from within.\n\nBut soon, she would learn the true cost of such power. A cost too high even for Marisa to borrow.","artistId":"yatagarasu","characterIds":["marisa"]},{"date":1751500890000,"reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1lqbcqk","url":["https://i.redd.it/9gfvrf2evjaf1.png"],"src":"https://x.com/GNwcq/status/1928392159880786284","desc":"This is referencing [**an old news**](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/swearing-parrots-uk-wildlife-park-customers-a4559041.html) where Lincolnshire Wildlife Park parrots got pulled from public display 'cause they were swearing at guests.
