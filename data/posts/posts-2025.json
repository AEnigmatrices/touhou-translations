On the other hand, this raises an interesting implication – that the Yakumo shikigami all use Chinese names. Chen is already one such example. Indeed, \"Chen\" is not a Japanese reading for the character.\n\nChen would be **Chéng**. Ran would be **Lán**. And as for Tsan here? **Cāng**. 🤨 Actually, I should also explain what these tonal marks mean.

It is a distinct object, a legendary artifact if you will, that grants **clarity**. So it is a name... wait a minute...\n\nAh... I get it now. That there's the keyword, isn't it? Clarity. Enlightenment. Becoming pure to fit in better with the Pure Land. Like how Yuyuko and Yōmu could hung around there back in SSiB 'cause they're pure (you know, Meikai counts as a Pure Land).\n\nWait a second minute... the idea behind the cast is that local yōkai have no goddamn clue they're even being invaded, right? That explains the humans with Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae. But Reisen? So moon rabbits... aren't yōkai? 🤔 This aligns with my theory still brewing in the pot that moon rabbits are genetically/spiritually modified humans, and they are the \"human village\" equivalent for the Lunar Capital.\n\nFinally, back to the translation point.

For those unaware, a lateral thinking riddle is a riddle where the participants are expected to ask questions related to the riddle in order to figure out the answer.\n\nThe riddle goes like this:\n\n> *A man went to a seaside restaurant and ordered \"sea turtle soup.\" After taking a single sip, he confirmed that it was real sea turtle soup. He paid the bill, went home, and killed himself. Why?*\n\nAnd the answer?\n\n> *The man had once been shipwrecked with friends and drifted to an island. There was no food, and the others began eating the flesh of those who had died in order to survive. The man, however, stubbornly refused to eat human flesh. One of his friends, unable to watch him die, lied and told him, \"This is sea turtle soup,\" tricking him into eating human flesh and surviving until they were all rescued. Later at the restaurant, the man tasted real sea turtle soup for the first time and realized the taste was different. With that, he came to realize the horrible truth and, in his despair, took his own life.*",

So she would conventionally count as a servant to Byakuren (for one, she takes care of the temple when Byakuren's out). And yet at the same time, she's an avatar of Bishamonten. Byakuren worships Bishamonten. She wouldn't conventionally count as Byakuren's servant since Byakuren worships her as Bishamonten's proxy.\n- **Futo** is pretty much Miko's vassal, so she is her servant in a way.\n- **Clownpiece** is Hecatia's servant.\n- **Mai** and **Satono** are Okina's servants.\n- **Mayumi** is Keiki's servant.\n- **Megumu** is... also technically a servant if we look at it from the hierarchy stance like Futo. Her superior is Tenma. I think we may also argue that for UM, it should have been **Tsukasa** (who is certainly a servant) as the one who's supposed to be the Stage 5 boss, but Megumu jumped in.\n\nIn a way and very fittingly, **Seija** is the odd one out here.",

Except maybe Margaret, who craved garlic out of all things while she was pregnant, and still kept peeling more after she had popped them out. Still, one hell of a cook though, probably the best in the estate's history. Sakuya still has a long way to go to match old Marge's spotted dick. Bitch never wrote down her recipes, and took them with her to the grave.\n\nOne time Remilia called Reimu over to be a medium in exchange for Meiling's helping hand fixing some stairs leading to the shrine – had to throw in a free supper too to make her accept the deal. Apparently, a séance is considered out-of-line here in Gensōkyō, and Remilia got chewed out by Eiki for that (and continued with Reimu through the dinner). Remilia did get a few sentences though.

Everywhere else, she's a ghost like Yuyuko. So I suppose ZUN's idea is that she's a ghost who used to be vengeful?\n\nAlso... unless Akyū was mistaken, Tojiko's lightning ability is not a Soga family thing too (which on the contrary can certainly be the case). Tojiko's lightning comes from the simple fact that she's an onryō – it's a racial ability. This means **Mizuchi** should be able to use lightning as well.\n\nLightning seems to be equated with anger in Touhou.",

A dog running across the sky as a **shooting star**... Huh. And eclipses were attributed to the tiangou swallowing the moon.\n\nThere's a version of the Chang'e legend where the tiangou was Houyi's hunting dog... after Chang'e took the elixir and fled, the dog licked up the remaining elixir on the floor, chased after Chang'e and swallowed her along with the moon she's hiding on (later spitting them out after getting a reward). The tiangou then eventually became Erlang Shen's dog – [**Xiàotiān Quǎn**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaotian_Quan).\n\nSo we have here a yōkai shooting star dog who took the Hōrai Elixir, was instrumental in concluding the Chang'e affair on the side of the Lunarians, and was the hunting dog of the famous three-eyed Chinese warrior god who is an equal to the legendary to Sun Wukong?\n\nHuh, now that's a decent ground to ship Satori with Aya/Momiji/Hatate/Megumu.

But the sentence definitely paints a different picture. Akyū here is saying that the matches repeat until Reimu scores a win; and once the victor (within the same sentence, that would logically be Reimu) is decided, then the game is over.\n\nWait a minute... I think... isn't this last sentence referring to incidents? The phrase by itself doesn't say what is repeated, and the previous sentences are not talking about spell card duels anymore, but incidents. Which means this is a way of saying that Reimu must **continue** and persist in resolving the incident until she scores a win and put that incident to an end.\n\nWhich means the \"game\" here does not refer to an individual spell card duel, and the sentence is basically saying – \"**The incident continues until the shrine maiden claims victory – once a resolution is reached, this game comes to an end.**\"",

Maintaining the shrine. Organizing festivals. Arranging banquets. Managing the finances. Keeping records. Reaching out to the Human Village.

If we home in, then Mystia is probably from Kōchi/Tosa herself – the south side of Shikoku (starting region of [**Chosokabe**](https://youtu.be/a2jxs3l821Y), for Shogun 2 players). Shit, now I'm associating Mystia with bows now.\n\nOut of topic at this point, but I think the reason why the Chosokabe gets extra farming income might be a reference to their Ichiryō Gusoku (though extra income is probably a bad reflection). The gist of the system is that the Chosokabe really embraced the boundary between farmers and warriors. Every peasant had one set of equipment (as opposed to samurai having multiple), and so they were very quick to muster (save for farming season), already fit and disciplined.",

I guess kinda like *The Great Gatsby*.\n\nOne little detail with this setup is that this novel's author is called ***Murasaki** Shikibu*. That exact same character for ***Yukari***. One assumption we can play around with is that this is Yakumo Yukari, full stop. However, some circumstance drove her to end up looking like Merry.\n\nIf we position this in such a way that Shikibu became a sukima yōkai later (1000s), then that definitely makes her younger than Mokō and possibly Akyū (700s). Murasaki Shikibu was possibly a Fujiwara.\n\nWait a minute... Murasaki Shikibu... Murasaki Shiki... Yakumo Yukari × Shiki Eiki? 🤔",

And it's a Heian period thing... so Byakuren's time.\n\n\"Ventilation\" also doubles as \"communication\" within an organization. So if your office has bad ventilation... you get the idea.",

Something ZUN can (and by that, I mean probably won't) do is revealing Banki being a part-timer at Geidontei. That she works the day shift, so the yōkai regulars would have no idea about her, and she's so good at hiding it that Miyoi couldn't tell in the first place that she's a rokurokubi.\n\nThinking about the makeup trend, I think it's the pretty likely that it's \"whatever washed up and got distributed to the village\". Might be some lost boxes of foundations and lipsticks that sell like hot cakes in the village whenever they come up. Maybe Yukari sets the trend by gapping specific items in.\n\nWhile it's funny and cute to think that Hime subsists on sea grass, if we assume that she really is a smelt, then she should be carnivorous 🐟 Anyway, I guess in this case it's safe to assume that she doesn't know about utensils either. Forget chopsticks, she probably thinks a fork is a hair brush.\n\nAnd more importantly, given that she is a fish, Hime definitely has a slimy skin. 🗿 No, don't you f#cking dare grab the food with your hands.

Yeah... somehow, I don't think Eirin would be the type to plaster her name like that. Hōrai is catchy.\n\nEientei was initially just Kaguya and Eirin, right? Then it is quite possible that when Tewi moved in, they did a lot of renovations which would include this room, Reisen's room, and the rabbit doors all over the place. That is to say, Eientei back then might have been much, much more modest.\n\nHuh... so that's the relationship. The \"Daikokusama\" we see the rabbits pretty much worship is specifically Ōkuninushi – the kami who helped Tewi. The conflation came about because \"Daikoku\" is another way to pronounce \"Ōkuni\".\n\n***\n\nWow. Daikokuten is also related to Shinmyōmaru's Miracle Mallet – it's the mallet he holds in his image. There is also a triple deity form combining Daikokuten with Bishamonten and Benzaiten. And of course, since Daikokuten comes from Mahakala... play the conflation game right, then the patron of the Earth Rabbits is no other than **Okina,** as Matarajin is conflated with Mahakala – meaning Nazrin is Okina's servant, Shō is Okina's avatar, and Byakuren is Okina's believer. Last one is extra spicy because Matarajin is a Tendai thing, while Byakuren is Shingon.\n\nSo if we divide Gensōkyō with this assumption, both the Earth Rabbits of Eientei and the monks of Myōrenji will align with Okina.\n\n***\n\nAnd I love that little donation box there.

Is it really just nostalgia?\n\nIf we go by the omake, we can make this conjecture. Ariya abandoned Yuiman to the Lunarians. Just because she's stubborn on rejecting all changes. Before setting off the incident, Eirin definitely briefed Kanako about the pyramid. She definitely already knew from the start that Yuiman's in there.\n\nAnd we can accommodate the scenario further by assuming that even though the Lunarians took over Ariya and Yuiman's shrine, the location itself remains Ariya's shrine. This means the following may be the case – the Lunarian engineers didn't implement something as basic as throttling the data input for Yuiman simply because they couldn't. The shrine inherently rejects change. They were already pushing the limits just setting Yuiman up for purification duties and the pipeline to the Lunar Capital.\n\nIn this interpretation, we can say that Ariya has some responsibility over this incident.",

There are a lot of kamis who are also ichigami – famous names like Daikoku-sama revered by the Earth Rabbits, Ebisu, Inari, Jizō... Despite that, however, I still hold my candle for the theory. I do love the prospect that **both of Sakuya's older sisters have revealed themselves in Gensōkyō.**\n\nAnother thing would be the [**Hare and Ke.**](https://kuon.tokyo/blogs/blog/hare-and-ke) Fan translations seem to have gone with Chimata being a \"god of revelry\", which I personally think it's a bit off.

And additional note that I'm guessing at this point that this contrasts with the \"gloomy\" 陰 – basically Hina's a socially awkward introvert.\n\nAnd finally, there's a little nuance with the Ms. Kagiyama.

Using -shi here is equivalent to actually calling another person Miss/Mister like it's a conference or something.
