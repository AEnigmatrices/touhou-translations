Indeed, \"Chen\" is not a Japanese reading for the character.\n\nChen would be **Chéng**. Ran would be **Lán**.

It is a distinct object, a legendary artifact if you will, that grants **clarity**. So it is a name... wait a minute...\n\nAh... I get it now. That there's the keyword, isn't it? Clarity. Enlightenment. Becoming pure to fit in better with the Pure Land. Like how Yuyuko and Yōmu could hung around there back in SSiB 'cause they're pure (you know, Meikai counts as a Pure Land).\n\nWait a second minute... the idea behind the cast is that local yōkai have no goddamn clue they're even being invaded, right? That explains the humans with Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae. But Reisen? So moon rabbits... aren't yōkai? 🤔 This aligns with my theory still brewing in the pot that moon rabbits are genetically/spiritually modified humans, and they are the \"human village\" equivalent for the Lunar Capital.\n\nFinally, back to the translation point. The basis for my current argument is:\n- \"Hourai no Kusuri\" = Hōrai Elixir.\n- \"Kanju no Kusuri\" = Ultramarine Orb Elixir??? 🤨 Why not Kanju Elixir?",

For those unaware, a lateral thinking riddle is a riddle where the participants are expected to ask questions related to the riddle in order to figure out the answer.\n\nThe riddle goes like this:\n\n> *A man went to a seaside restaurant and ordered \"sea turtle soup.\" After taking a single sip, he confirmed that it was real sea turtle soup. He paid the bill, went home, and killed himself. Why?*\n\nAnd the answer?\n\n> *The man had once been shipwrecked with friends and drifted to an island. There was no food, and the others began eating the flesh of those who had died in order to survive. The man, however, stubbornly refused to eat human flesh. One of his friends, unable to watch him die, lied and told him, \"This is sea turtle soup,\" tricking him into eating human flesh and surviving until they were all rescued. Later at the restaurant, the man tasted real sea turtle soup for the first time and realized the taste was different. With that, he came to realize the horrible truth and, in his despair, took his own life.*",

Byakuren worships Bishamonten.

Her superior is Tenma.

Still, one hell of a cook though, probably the best in the estate's history. Sakuya still has a long way to go to match old Marge's spotted dick. Bitch never wrote down her recipes, and took them with her to the grave.\n\nOne time Remilia called Reimu over to be a medium in exchange for Meiling's helping hand fixing some stairs leading to the shrine – had to throw in a free supper too to make her accept the deal. Apparently, a séance is considered out-of-line here in Gensōkyō, and Remilia got chewed out by Eiki for that (and continued with Reimu through the dinner). Remilia did get a few sentences though.

Kinda native, but also foreign. 'Cause the dragon idea came with Buddhism, that we can trace all the way back to the Indian naga which became dragon when it got to China.\n\nAnd there's the whole thing with being conflated with Watatsumi – making Toyohime and Yorihime's mom/dad the patron god of Gensōkyō...",

Everywhere else, she's a ghost like Yuyuko. So I suppose ZUN's idea is that she's a ghost who used to be vengeful?\n\nAlso... unless Akyū was mistaken, Tojiko's lightning ability is not a Soga family thing too (which on the contrary can certainly be the case). Tojiko's lightning comes from the simple fact that she's an onryō – it's a racial ability. This means **Mizuchi** should be able to use lightning as well.\n\nLightning seems to be equated with anger in Touhou.",

A dog running across the sky as a **shooting star**... Huh. And eclipses were attributed to the tiangou swallowing the moon.\n\nThere's a version of the Chang'e legend where the tiangou was Houyi's hunting dog... after Chang'e took the elixir and fled, the dog licked up the remaining elixir on the floor, chased after Chang'e and swallowed her along with the moon she's hiding on (later spitting them out after getting a reward). The tiangou then eventually became Erlang Shen's dog – [**Xiàotiān Quǎn**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaotian_Quan).\n\nSo we have here a yōkai shooting star dog who took the Hōrai Elixir, was instrumental in concluding the Chang'e affair on the side of the Lunarians, and was the hunting dog of the famous three-eyed Chinese warrior god who is an equal to the legendary to Sun Wukong?\n\nHuh, now that's a decent ground to ship Satori with Aya/Momiji/Hatate/Megumu. There's no perfect match though. It has to be a **black dog**... You know what. Just check out Black Myth. Yes, I'm saying Tenma is that dog.",

Akyū here is saying that the matches repeat until Reimu scores a win; and once the victor (within the same sentence, that would logically be Reimu) is decided, then the game is over.\n\nWait a minute... I think... isn't this last sentence referring to incidents? The phrase by itself doesn't say what is repeated, and the previous sentences are not talking about spell card duels anymore, but incidents. Which means this is a way of saying that Reimu must **continue** and persist in resolving the incident until she scores a win and put that incident to an end.\n\nWhich means the \"game\" here does not refer to an individual spell card duel, and the sentence is basically saying – \"**The incident continues until the shrine maiden claims victory – once a resolution is reached, this game comes to an end.**\"",

The vegetarian thing seems to be mostly Mahayana. Vajrayana (Tibetan) permits eating meat, though it's more on the practical side since vegetables are kinda hard to come by in the mountains. Theravada also allows meat consumption, referencing to how the Buddha allowed monks to consume alms that had meat – as long as the animals weren't killed specifically to be those alms.\n\nRyōtei is basically a high-end traditional Japanese restaurant. And the Keiki menu there is a reference to her signature phrase.",

Maintaining the shrine. Organizing festivals. Arranging banquets. Managing the finances. Keeping records. Reaching out to the Human Village.

The yamanba respect this kind of seniority, but that seems to be the extent of it. All of them by definition keep to themselves, to each their own.\n\nThough she seems to style herself as the leading figure, she does actually work to keep the sanctuary the way it is, so the reclusive locals love her. And so her leadership stems from that kind of charismatic popularity rather than any sort of established contract.\n\nJust because yamanba are solitary by nature doesn't mean they are utterly incapable of collective action though, right? I can imagine Ubame doing exactly this in the past when maybe the tengu or some other faction decided to encroach on their territory.\n\n***\"We gotta teach 'em another lesson, y'all!\"***\n\nMaybe they once decimated the tengu and rampaged across Yōkai Mountain before.
