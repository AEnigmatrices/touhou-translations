For those unaware, a lateral thinking riddle is a riddle where the participants are expected to ask questions related to the riddle in order to figure out the answer.\n\nThe riddle goes like this:\n\n> *A man went to a seaside restaurant and ordered \"sea turtle soup.\" After taking a single sip, he confirmed that it was real sea turtle soup. He paid the bill, went home, and killed himself. Why?*\n\nAnd the answer?\n\n> *The man had once been shipwrecked with friends and drifted to an island. There was no food, and the others began eating the flesh of those who had died in order to survive. The man, however, stubbornly refused to eat human flesh. One of his friends, unable to watch him die, lied and told him, \"This is sea turtle soup,\" tricking him into eating human flesh and surviving until they were all rescued. Later at the restaurant, the man tasted real sea turtle soup for the first time and realized the taste was different. With that, he came to realize the horrible truth and, in his despair, took his own life.*",

Byakuren worships Bishamonten. She wouldn't conventionally count as Byakuren's servant since Byakuren worships her as Bishamonten's proxy.\n- **Futo** is pretty much Miko's vassal, so she is her servant in a way.\n- **Clownpiece** is Hecatia's servant.\n- **Mai** and **Satono** are Okina's servants.\n- **Mayumi** is Keiki's servant.\n- **Megumu** is... also technically a servant if we look at it from the hierarchy stance like Futo. Her superior is Tenma. I think we may also argue that for UM, it should have been **Tsukasa** (who is certainly a servant) as the one who's supposed to be the Stage 5 boss, but Megumu jumped in.\n\nIn a way and very fittingly, **Seija** is the odd one out here.",

I think... isn't this last sentence referring to incidents? The phrase by itself doesn't say what is repeated, and the previous sentences are not talking about spell card duels anymore, but incidents. Which means this is a way of saying that Reimu must **continue** and persist in resolving the incident until she scores a win and put that incident to an end.\n\nWhich means the \"game\" here does not refer to an individual spell card duel, and the sentence is basically saying ‚Äì \"**The incident continues until the shrine maiden claims victory ‚Äì once a resolution is reached, this game comes to an end.**\"",
