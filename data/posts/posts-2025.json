Indeed, \"Chen\" is not a Japanese reading for the character.\n\nChen would be **Chéng**. Ran would be **Lán**.

It is a distinct object, a legendary artifact if you will, that grants **clarity**. So it is a name... wait a minute...\n\nAh... I get it now. That there's the keyword, isn't it? Clarity. Enlightenment. Becoming pure to fit in better with the Pure Land. Like how Yuyuko and Yōmu could hung around there back in SSiB 'cause they're pure (you know, Meikai counts as a Pure Land).\n\nWait a second minute... the idea behind the cast is that local yōkai have no goddamn clue they're even being invaded, right? That explains the humans with Reimu, Marisa, and Sanae. But Reisen? So moon rabbits... aren't yōkai? 🤔 This aligns with my theory still brewing in the pot that moon rabbits are genetically/spiritually modified humans, and they are the \"human village\" equivalent for the Lunar Capital.\n\nFinally, back to the translation point. The basis for my current argument is:\n- \"Hourai no Kusuri\" = Hōrai Elixir.\n- \"Kanju no Kusuri\" = Ultramarine Orb Elixir??? 🤨 Why not Kanju Elixir?",

For those unaware, a lateral thinking riddle is a riddle where the participants are expected to ask questions related to the riddle in order to figure out the answer.\n\nThe riddle goes like this:\n\n> *A man went to a seaside restaurant and ordered \"sea turtle soup.\" After taking a single sip, he confirmed that it was real sea turtle soup. He paid the bill, went home, and killed himself. Why?*\n\nAnd the answer?\n\n> *The man had once been shipwrecked with friends and drifted to an island. There was no food, and the others began eating the flesh of those who had died in order to survive. The man, however, stubbornly refused to eat human flesh. One of his friends, unable to watch him die, lied and told him, \"This is sea turtle soup,\" tricking him into eating human flesh and surviving until they were all rescued. Later at the restaurant, the man tasted real sea turtle soup for the first time and realized the taste was different. With that, he came to realize the horrible truth and, in his despair, took his own life.*",
